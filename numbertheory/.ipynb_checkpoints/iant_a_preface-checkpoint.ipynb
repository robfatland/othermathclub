    "\n",
    "This essay indirectly motivates taking up a study of number theory. It \n",
    "was inspired by two people: Caltech mathematics professor Tom Apostol; \n",
    "and Scientific American columnist Martin Gardner. Both as Paul Erdos would \n",
    "say have 'left'. \n",

    "> Apocryphal story: \n",
    "A student of rock climbing was led by his instructor to a rock \n",
    "formation. 'Here is your problem: Climb\n",
    "to the top' the instructor said, pointing to a vertical cliff face.\n",
    "Whereupon (the instructor departing) \n",
    "the student examined the indicated cliff face, finding it to be vertical, smooth \n",
    "and featureless, with not so much as a tiny handhold. \n",
    "The student sat upon the ground, staring at the cliff. \n",
    "A year later he returned to his instructor.\n",
    "'I have not solved the problem yet' he reported.\n",
    "His instructor responded, 'Oh I assumed you had died.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I had the privilege of attending Professor Apostol's \n",
    "lectures in person in 1982. In keeping with Caltech's\n",
    "culture of irreverence, my fellow classmates and I referred to \n",
    "Tom Apostol as '*Tommy*'. I see him in my mind's \n",
    "eye standing before the blackboard in Noyes Laboratory, \n",
    "all business as he begins a lecture on a version\n",
    "of calculus more rigorous than the high school version. \n",
    "At some point in his narrative he would make an impossible, \n",
    "outrageous mathematical claim. There would follow a pause to \n",
    "let it sink in... one might scoff quietly... \n",
    "and then Professor Apostol \n",
    "would continue with the portentous remark,\n",
    "\"Now nobody can stop me from *making this claim*...\" and then\n",
    "another pause... do we see it yet?... and the logical \n",
    "argument would follow, at the end of \n",
    "which said claim is quite reasonably true. As Freshmen \n",
    "we did not always appreciate the fun of this approach. \n",
    "Speaking for myself: My eventual enlightenment necessitated\n",
    "additional staring at notes and asking upperclassmen for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in retrospect I \n",
    "appreciate Tommy's lecture style. He happily carried the\n",
    "burden of justifying his results; and always one had a\n",
    "sense of forging ahead. Better keep up!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent of this notebook is to circle back \n",
    "and start over with Tommy, on a new subject, the topic \n",
    "of number theory. \n",
    "The starting point is grade school:\n",

    "Going back still further in my personal history: I have found an\n",
    "interesting dichotomy in looking for clues to the big picture. \n",
    "The book **Dinosaurs and More Dinosaurs** (1971) says aloud on every \n",
    "page, 'There is a big world out there beyond your direct experience.'\n",
    "Being seven and I must admit rather naive for my age I just took it \n",
    "as a given that this bigger world was real and ours to discover.\n",
    "But then there were the two books about Alice and her complicated\n",
    "dreams: Seeming real page by page but clearly fiction... so on the one \n",

    "once the book is finished and set down we're back to the ordinary. The \n",
    "dichotomy can be dealt with by looking for more books... but the point\n",

    "American we were gifted at regular intervals with flashes of\n",
    "something marvelous. Here at last was the Red Queen: To read \n",
    "Gardner's *Mathematical Games* column was to climb up on the mantle\n",
    "above the fireplace, to look through into the Looking Glass room,\n",
    "and as the mirror disssolved into mist, to climb through and \n",
    "become a character in the story. Here ideas mattered in proportion \n",
    "to their strangeness and unfamiliariarity.\n",
    "Gardner gave us logic puzzles, paradoxes, prisoners both\n",

    "we are off to explore. But what happens when the trail grows cold, when\n",
    "we hit a wall, run out of ideas to try? This is the point of the story\n",
    "of the rock climbing student. Consider an indirect method where one develops \n",
    "a skill called 'getting help'.  \n",
    "Sometimes help is not available. Sometimes sources of \n",
    "help are hidden. Sometimes they walk away and we have to go chase them\n",
    "down. Of course the reverse can be true as well: We can become so\n",
    "habituated to help that we become fearful of the problem. So there is \n",
    "a balance to strike; but I feel that it is too easy to err on the \n",
