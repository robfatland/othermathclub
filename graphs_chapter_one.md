This is a graph. 

It looks a bit like a bison to me. There is one loop and one isolated vertex all by itself, making this graph 
disconnected. As we get going we will avoid loops and disconnected graphs. We will avoid multiple edges between 
pairs of vertices as we have above in the shoulder of the bison. I fix these details in the version below… but let’s 
back up for some preparation before going further with graphs.
