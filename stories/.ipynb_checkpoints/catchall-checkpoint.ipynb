    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Now we learn about joining together a list of strings into a single string\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Investigate and describe what this line of code does:\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "You can delete or comment out any code \n",
    "that your wrote above in your **repl** project.  The three pieces of the program are\n",
    "down at the bottom of this page. This means you do not have to type the program\n",
    "in by hand. We recommend for the practice session (the Zoom call) that you \n",
    "copy-paste the code from below. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "However when you do the assignment on your own it is a bit better \n",
    "if you type it in, in terms of your learning. The best method of all is to read\n",
    "the description, try to write the code, and then check your code against the code\n",
    "given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's talk about what the program will do. There is \n",
    "a list of cells that all begin as zero except for the middle cell which is 1'. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n",
    "```\n",

    "Do you remember what it is called (from above)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to print that list on the screen. Think of this as a bunch of coins lined\n",
    "up where they are all Tails except the middle one is Heads. This is how things stand when\n",
    "time begins. These coins are our (very small) world. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to let time move forward one tick at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The way time moves forward is this: We will apply a Rule that generates a new \n",
    "list of cells. Guess what the Rule is called. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Once we have a new list what do we do? We print this new list. Then we apply the Rule \n",
    "again for the next tick of the clock, then print, then Rule, then print, then Rule and so on.\n",
    "\n",

    "Again: The list of cells is a **data structure** that records the history of \n",
    "this simple small world over time. Ok here we go...\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Remember that we actually use two data structures. One for **today** and one for **next**.\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This page is about writing Python code that is *minimal*. It is as small as possible to minimize places for bugs to hide. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to know how many times each unique letter or character appears in a string `s`. Let's write a function to \n",
    "do this called `UniqueCharCounts`. We will pass it a string `s`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def UniqueCharCounts(s): return [(u, list(s).count(u)) for u in sorted(set(s))]\n",
    "\n",
    "s = 'xxxabb'\n",
    "\n",
    "print(UniqueCharCounts(s))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Isn't that nice? Here is how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notice that `UniqueCharCounts()` is a **function** that returns something. So that *something* should be a list of counts of unique characters, right? \n",
    "- Let's imagine as in the example above that we sent the string `xxxabb`. The result should be a list of characters and counts, like this, alphabetized:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[ ('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('x', 3) ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notice that what is being returned by the function is in square brackets. This is how we declare a list in Python. \n",
    "- So whatever is inside the square brackets should generate the list above, again: `[ ('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('x', 3) ]`\n",
    "    - The good news is: This code takes advantage of the grammar rules of Python (the syntax) to do just this.\n",
    "- Notice inside the square brackets there are two things: `(u, list(s).count(u))` followed by a for loop `for u in sorted(set(s))`. \n",
    "    - This combination of two things does what we hope for: \n",
    "        - It runs the for loop and for each run through that loop...\n",
    "        - ...it generates a tuple like `('a', 1)`. \n",
    "- Let's look at what the for loop is doing. The for-loop variable is a dummy variable `u`. Inside the parens is `set(s)`. \n",
    "    - This breaks the string `s` apart into individual characters and makes a set out of them. \n",
    "    - A set is like a list with one important difference: A set may not have more than one of any of its elements. \n",
    "    - So this means that `set(s)` is the set of unique characters in the string `s`. It will be `('x', 'a', 'b')` in our example.\n",
    "    - What about the `sorted()` function applied to `set(s)`? As you might guess it sorts the elements of the set alphabetically. \n",
    "- So all told the for-loop is saying the following: \n",
    "    - Take the string `s`. \n",
    "    - Break it down as a set of unique characters (which in our example will be `('x', 'a', 'b')` ). \n",

    "\n",
    "How many ml of 0.25M  are needed to deliver 0.00450 moles of  during a chemical reaction?\n",
    "Suppose you needed to prepare a 100ml solution of 1.05M NaOH using 1.5M NaOH, distilled water, and a 100ml graduated cylinder. How would you do this?\n",
    "Define four ideas\n",
    "A couple of observations to begin with: We need a good working definition of both moles and molarity. We also need a good agreement on how we derive the mass of an atom or molecule. And we need to know why they stipulated a graduated cylinder. So this is four questions that I will answer. After that I will come back and re-state the problems. I hope they will be more tractable by then.\n",
    "\n",
    "One mole of something is one Avogadro's number of it; which is approximately 6e23 particles. That is 6 times ten raised to the twenty-third power; which is rather a lot. More accurately 6.022 but I will just use 6. It is interesting to consider how much space a mole of Honda civics would take up if they filled a cube.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way in addition to massive particles we can also have a mole of massless particles. In particular -- pun intended -- a mole of photons (light particles) is called an Einstein of photons, as before 6e23 of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the question of mass does not really come into play in our two problems... or maybe just a little bit... nevertheless I think it is worth connecting these moles (particle counts) to masses. So time out while we do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass of a bunch of identical particles\n",
    "I will take protons and neutrons to have a mass of one (1) and electrons as being massless, mass = zero (0). These are approximations. Furthermore for a given atom (fixed number of protons) there are variable numbers of neutrons possible. These atom variants are called isotopes. For example we hear plenty about  or Carbon-12 which has 6 protons + 6 neutrons... but there is a surprisingly large amount of C-13 in the world as well; and it is pretty stable. There is even C-14 but this tends to fall apart after a thousand years or so. But that is physics, not chemistry. Point is I'm going to just take the mass of Carbon to be 12, full stop. We see atomic masses on the periodic table with some extra digits like 12.003. I'm just going to round to the nearest integer. If we start working with mass spectrometers--whatever those are--then we can use those extra digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what are these proton units? Answer: They are called atomic mass units; where one proton has a mass of 1. This unit (I find) is now indicated by the letter u as in One Hydrogen atom has a mass of 1 u. Originally these were 'Daltons' and my chemistry friends still say Daltons so I will too. Daltons = atomic mass units (Da = u). We have not yet said what these are equivalent to in familiar units of mass. Let's do that next.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to connect moles to Daltons via kilograms. One Da is 1.66e-27kg. One mole of Hydrogen weighs less than one mole of carbon because moles are 'number of particles' and one Carbon is heavier than one Hydrogen. So moles do not translate to kilograms until you say moles of what. A mole of Hydrogen atoms -- each one weighing one Dalton -- weighs 6e23 (particles per mole) times 1 (Daltons per particle) times 1e-27 (kilograms per Dalton) = 0.001 kg. Informally we notice that .001 kg is one gram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the joke question 'What weighs more: A pound of feathers or a pound of bricks?' Well now you know a different version that is sensible: 'What weighs more: A mole of feathers or a mole of bricks?'\n",
    "\n",
    "So... this is why Avogadro's number was chosen to be that goofy number 6.022e23: So that \"a mole of something equals its (Daltons) weight in grams\". Therefore: Every time we see a mole of something and it has a molecular formula we can tot up all the atoms in that formula by their mass in Daltons; then change the word Daltons to grams; and then loudly we shall proclaim \"this many grams of this stuff is one mole of it\". For example in problem 26 we see  which is one Potassium (K) at 39 Da, one Manganese at 55 Da, and 4 Oxygen each at 16 Da for a total of 158 Da. So 158 grams of  is one mole of it. Or six hundred thousand million million million molecules.\n",

    "Onward to cylinders (graduated) and molarity (concentration)\n",
    "I have answered two of the four questions: What is a mole and how do we deal with the masses of molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next let's dispense with the graduated cylinder. These do not have a lot of spare capacity above the top line so a 100ml graduated cyclinder can be taken to hold only 100ml of liquid, not more. Therefore any solution-building we do can't exceed 100ml in the \"bucket\" at any one time. Which reminds me of gallon puzzles so let me give you one of those to work out while I go make sure I have a good working definition of molarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have two beakers that are not graduated. Let's say they were held back by Professor Erlenmeyer. They just have one line on the neck with a label showing how much you have when you fill to the line. One holds precisely 900ml and the other holds 400ml. Using a spigot of water flowing into a sink in your chemistry lab: How would you obtain 300ml of water? Is there only one way?\n",

    "Ok maybe I should expand that out a little bit. What I mean by molarity...\n",
    "\n",
    "Molarity is a measure of concentration. If you add salt and more salt and more salt to a glass of water you are increasing the concentration -- the molar concentration -- or the molarity -- of the salt in the water. Of course as you add salt you could tip out some of the solution to keep the volume of the solution constant. Since you are adding in pure salt and tipping out water-with-salt-dissolved the salt is winning and the concentration of salt is increasing. Let's restate this idea of concentration using more words. First take a deep breath; then read (aloud if possible) the following two paragraphs...\n",
    "\n",
    "Moles of something (say methane) per liters of something else (say kerosene) is molar concentration, also called molarity. Moles of sodium hydroxide per liter of water is another measure of molarity. Moles per liter is abbreviated with a capital M. Sometimes molar concentration is abbreviated as mol/l or the more confusing molL-1 which unpacks as moles = mol and liters = L and 'raised to the -1' means you put it in the denominator so you get moles divided by liters. So ten moles of some solute -- some thing -- in 20 liters of some solvent -- some liquidy thing -- would be 0.5 molar concentration or 0.5 moles per liter or 0.5mol/l or 0.5molL-1 or 0.5M.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the molarity of water dissolved in water? This is an Alice question but let's try it out. We have one liter of water which is 10 x 10 x 10 centimeters. One cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram. One liter of water weighs 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 grams. One molecule of water weighs 18 Daltons. One mole of water weighs 18 grams. So 1000 grams of water contains 1000 / 18 = 55.555 moles of water. Rounding up: Water is about 56 moles per liter. We dissolved this water \"in itself\" I suppose... there's nothing wrong with doing so but it seems odd that the solute and the solvent are the same thing. Usually in chemistry class the solute is not the solvent; so only a smarty-pants would proclaim 'Guess what! The concentration of water is 56 moles per liter!'... and then Professor Erlenmeyer says 'Sit down Ms Granger.'\n",

    "Spoiler alert: This could be wrong... but there is a better than 50% chance that it is right, in my estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call the answer X milliliters and notice the difference between the answer they want (X in milliliters) and the definition of molarity (moles per liter) that we work with. This we can address with unitary analysis: Keeping all the units in play to make sure the answer we get is in the units we want. In particular we introduce the ratio of liters to milliliters as (1 / 1000) (liters / milliliter).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way: Since we are working with moles and volumes we never actually need to calculate the mass of the  in grams; so we do not need Daltons or grams. This is a convenient aspect of working with moles like me.\n",

    "This in English is \"X-many milliliters of concentration 0.25 moles per liter equals .0045 moles; and don't forget to convert from liters to milliliters.\" Notice that the molarity M I have written as moles / liter. The word 'liter' in the denominator cancels the word 'liter' in the numerator of the (1/1000) fraction. The 'milliliters' also cancel leaving just moles. That is: On the left side the only units that don't cancel out are moles and that is also what we have on the right side. This means that our units balance out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now numerically: When you take everything but X over to the right side you get 0.0045 * 1000 / 0.25 which is 18.\n",

    "First we notice we are starting with a concentration of 1.5M NaOH and ending with a concentration of 1.05M. This is good news because it means we are simply going to dilute the original solution. How much of it do we pour into the graduated cyclinder before topping it off with distilled water? Let's call that amount Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to place the Y ml of 1.5M NaOH on the left side of an equation and multiply by the molar concentration to arrive at a number of moles. On the right I also calculate how many moles we would have of NaOH if we have a volume of 100 ml (I use 1/10 liter) and a molar concentration of 1.05 mol / liter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Y ml x (1/1000) (liters/ml) x 1.5 moles / liter = (1/10) liters x 1.05 (mol / liter)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we have the units canceling leaving moles = moles; so that's good. In fact it is essential. Then the numbers give us Y = 70 ml. This makes sense because we are going from a concentration of 1.5M to 1.05M which is a bit more than two-thirds; and 70 is a bit more than 2/3 of 100, the volume of the graduated cylinder.\n",

    "\n",
    "If I pour in the NaOH first and then add water the sodium ions will stay on the bottom perhaps not mixing very well. If I do it in the other order maybe the sodium ions will mix into the water as they sink. That's really just a guess. The  ions I don't think have any trouble mixing in.\n",

    "Four answers... first for impatient people, then some historical narrative, then an art-based narrative, and then finally back to the answer for impatient people.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those impatient for a working understanding\n",
    "Look around you: Light falls into your eyes and your brain interprets the pattern as a representation of objects or matter. What is this matter? A computer, a chair, maybe some lunch? Back in 1680 or so with Isaac Newton poking around we (the human race) began to get very methodical and systematic about asking 'What is this matter made of really?' The natural course of inquiry was to try and break things down into smaller and smaller pieces; and then ask 'if I understand the pieces do I understand the whole chunk of matter?' This question occupied the intellectual curiosity and stubborn persistence of the human race: From then until now; where a large portion of the puzzles was figured out by the 1920s. This section summarizes the results: Very approximately.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pick up a book and a styrofoam box you notice a difference in mass and volume. Those are basic properties of objects. When you let go of the book it falls to the floor; so we say 'there is a force called gravity that operates between objects with mass.' So far so good. Is this everything we need to understand laws of force? No. We need to add another item to our short list of properties of matter: Charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a comb through someone's hair a bunch of times and hold the comb up to a balloon there is some stickiness going on apparently not related to gravity. This demonstrates a property of some matter -- but not all matter -- called charge. Also sometimes called electrical charge; so you can see the word electron sneaking in here.\n",
    "\n",
    "At very small scales matter is made of aggregates of atoms called molecules. Atoms are the building blocks. They in turn are assembled from three smaller building blocks: Protons, neutrons and electrons. The neutrons do not have an electrical charge; the electrons and the protons do. All three have mass. And now here is the curious thing: The mass of the electron is about 1/1836 the mass of the proton; but the charge of the electron is equal to the charge of the proton except that it is of opposite sign. By convention we say the electron has charge -1 and the proton has charge +1. The rule of charge-based force is: Opposite charges attract and like charges repel. So electrons and protons are drawn together.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no good reason I know of why electrons are so light in comparison to protons and yet have precisely the same magnitude of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the implication of a force of attraction based on electrical charges, where opposites attract. Perhaps when an electron is near a proton they just collapse together to form a neutron that has a total charge of zero. This is a great idea but it does not work out in practice. This paragraph exists to tell you that some of the rules of how things work on the scale of electrons and protons are very different from the rules of how things work on the scale of you and me. There is not much we can do about this; but the rules for small things are quite interesting and fun to learn about so on balance I think it is a win for us that they are different. Anyway one of the small things rules says that electrons and protons will stick together by electrical force of attraction but only so close to one another and no closer. As a result we have a model of atoms where protons gather together in the nucleus or center of the atom creating a point of positive charge and electrons gather about this center (but not at the center) as smears or clouds of negative charge. When seen from a distance an atom with the same number of electrons as protons appears to have no charge: It is electrically neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this picture complete we need to add neutrons -- recall they have no charge -- that are also bound up in the nucleus of the atom with the protons. Neutrons have no charge and weigh about the same as protons, maybe 1% heavier. You might reasonably ask: If there are a bunch of protons stuck together at the center of the atom... and they all have positive charge... and like charges repel or push one another away... and if the neutrons are there also but have no charge to speak of... then doesn't this repelling force cause the nucleus to disintegrate or even fly apart?? It is a good question because, yes, protons do push one another away. But atoms do not disintegrate and this is due to another one of the small things rules. This new rule states that there is yet another force called the nuclear force that is much stronger than the electrical force and it pulls the positively charged protons and the un-charged neutrons together. The nuclear force binds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of the atom. This makes the atom stable and we are now arriving at our model of how atoms work in chemistry. There is one more idea needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final idea concerns the electrons that are not (by the first rule of small things) permitted to exist inside the nucleus of the atom. Like the protons (with positive charge) the electrons (with negative charge) tend to push one another away. The electrons exist as little smears or clouds of negative charge that are attempting to be close to the positively charged nucleus by attraction but far from one another by repulsion at the same time. This leads to some very interesting mathematics where we can derive the shapes of the electron clouds. These electron cloud shapes are given the rather unfortunate (because it is misleading) name atomic orbitals. For the moment I will stick with the descriptive language: Electrons exist in differently shaped cloudy smears around the nucleus of the atom. The cloud smears stick out in different directions. In summary we have negative charge electron cloud smears and positive charge protons in the nucleus. These charges interact to create a kind of lumpy bumpy atomic charge geometry; and as one lumpy bumpy charge smear atom happens to pass near another one: They might just stick together. This creates a very complicated world of atomic interactions that on our large human being scale we call chemistry. So chemistry is in a sense the connection between the world of small things and the world of large things; and it depends entirely upon the finer details of how negatively charged electrons interact between atoms.\n",

    "A second look at 'what are electrons?'\n",
    "The story of electrons is closely bound up with the story of light. Let us return therefore to Isaac Newton's thoughts on the nature of light, around the year 1660. He noticed that a traditional telescope magnifies by bending light through glass lenses; and this caused a problem because the different colors of light would each bend differently. This creates little rainbows around white dots of light (say like stars) as in the image below. This blurriness could use a descriptive name; and since the rainbow-smears are not what we want we can say \"It is a mess.\" And since color is involved we can say \"In fact it is a color mess.\" However people are not happy with short simple terms like this so instead they say \"It is a chromatic aberration.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "drawing\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton noticed that reflected light bounced the same no matter its color... the reflection angle did not change from red to yellow to green to cyan to blue. So... he went to some pains to invent and build a new type of telescope from curved mirrors rather than lenses. Today such telescopes are called Newtonian reflector telescopes. This little parenthesis is to emphasize two things: First that Newton saw the question of how light works as a challenge, and second that he was prepared to take on that challenge in every way he could imagine. He persevered by devious plans and schemes to better understand light. He thought about what it means to polish glass, for example, and he carried out a famous experiment on sunlight using prisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now before going further with Sir Isaac: What is the plan here? The plan is to tell three stories spanning from 1670 to 1905. The first concerns Isaac Newton's disagreements with certain people on the nature of light. He did an experiment with prisms and suggested using the word spectrum for the rainbows this produces. The idea of a spectrum leads into the second story, about how spectrums differ one from another; and what can one figure out from careful observation of spectra? (Which do you prefer: spectrums or spectra?) Part two arrives at the predictive nature of good science: 'If my understanding is correct then it must be true that...'\n",
    "\n",
    "The third story jumps to 1905 to connect electrons and light once more. It involves a fellow employed in the city of Bern in Switzerland as a patent office clerk. His job was to evaluate new inventions... did they deserve a patent? But in his spare time he was able to indulge his curiosity on the nature of light and electricity. Since Newton's time he had the benefit of 250 years of additional thought, observation and experiment to build upon. So those will be the three stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part One: Prism sentences\n",
    "Newton put some very opaque curtains at his window blocking the light; except where he put a little prism. On a sunny day this prism would break the light of the sun into a rainbow of color on the far wall of his room. This he called a spectrum. Now sunlight is white whereas the spectrum cast upon the wall was red and orange and yellow and green and cyan and blue and violet. How to explain this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well prisms and rainbows were well known; so there were already two ideas about the nature of light popular at this time. Notice the word popular: Does this not imply that science is a parade of fads and fashions? Yes! Absolutely true, but with one little asterisk at the end, perhaps like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Science is a progression of fads and fashions; of opinions, biases, beliefs, even prejudices*.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so what about this asterisk? There must be the accompanying asterisk at the bottom of the page, and just what is written after that? Well in 1660 (independent of Newton) a group of people in London decided to form a club with the motto Nullius in verba which is Latin for \"Don't take anyone's word for it.\" The purpose of the club was to start explaining how things worked; and their motto was important as a milestone in the shift to repeatable demonstration as the basis for belief in a particular explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*but remember: Nullius in verba!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so what were these two related fashionable ideas about light? First white is a color. And second light is a phenomenon of waves. Newton through his experiments arrived at different conclusions: That light is composed of particles (corpuscles he said) and that white light is in fact a superposition of our familiar colors and not a color itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very nice demonstration of Newton's experiments with prisms here. I highly recommend it; it runs about five minutes. It includes a good example of how to not over-simplify when it discusses recombining a spectrum into white light.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to miss a small point here: In Newton's experiment can you still explain the results using the old idea that 'white light is a color'? Certainly you can but Newton's explanation has the advantage of being simple and self-consistent. Similarly his conclusion that light is made of particles led to further ongoing debate. The history is fun to read but to conclude our first story let's imprint in our memory this image of Newton as a young man (in his twenties) setting up a prism to cast a solar spectrum on the wall of his darkened dormitory room.\n"

    "    * Program using parameters rather than constants (hard-coding is less flexible than parameters)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First ask: You will have to set up some tools that will enable\n",
    "you to do productive work. At the beginning there are two.\n",
    "First sign up for a free student account on a \n",
    "[website](https://replit.com) and learn to use it. \n",
    "Second sign in to the club Slack channel.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Build for yourself a **participatory** and **initiative-based** frame of mind. \n",
    "Consider a student named *Esmerelda* \n",
    "who was in the club a couple of years ago. \n",
    "Whenever we were talking over Zoom or in person she would constantly \n",
    "interrupt to ask questions. Guess whether this was a good thing or a bad thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "Answer: It was not bad, it was not good, it was ***Awesome***. \n",
    "The percentage of times she was made to feel *bad* about asking\n",
    "questions was Zero Percent. Other students benefitted from her questions.\n",
    "She was often saying\n",
    "out loud what they were thinking. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Be ready to interrupt and say what is confusing. Be like Esmerelda. \n",
    "Let's be ready to work with and communicate with our guides and our fellow students. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3\n",
    " \n",
    "The club has no grades and no penalties and no deadlines except for Demo Nights.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, day to day, it is easy to just skip it; not do any Python. \n",
    "Plus there are hundreds of things in the world that are\n",
    "always trying to get our attention and our time. Some of these things are great, like learning \n",
    "to play the viola. Let's do those cool things! But some of those things are \n",
    "watching YouTube videos about throwing watermelons off of bridges. Those \n",
    "things are not worth it. Ask #3 is **make time to do Python and do Python**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "really what you can commit to: Sign up!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How much time? You should agree with\n",
    "your parent or guardian that you can devote 20 minutes per day for five days every week on \n",
    "average. That's close to 2 hours of coding per week, a minimum necessary to make progress. \n",
    "Much better for you is to have at least one longer session per week where you don't have \n",
    "interruptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
