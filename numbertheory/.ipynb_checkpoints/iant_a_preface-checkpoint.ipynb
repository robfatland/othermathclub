    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This essay concerns taking up the study of number theory. This\n",
    "was inspired by two people: Caltech mathematics professor Tom Apostol; \n",
    "and Scientific American columnist Martin Gardner. \n",
    "Both -- as Paul Paul Erdös would say -- have left. \n",

    "> Apocryphal story: \n",
    "A student of rock climbing was led by his instructor to a rock \n",
    "formation. 'Here is your problem: Climb\n",
    "to the top' the instructor said, pointing to a vertical cliff face.\n",
    "Whereupon (the instructor departing) \n",
    "the student examined the indicated cliff face, finding it to be vertical, smooth \n",
    "and featureless, with not so much as a tiny handhold. \n",
    "The student sat upon the ground, staring at the cliff. \n",
    "A year later he returned to his instructor.\n",
    "'I have not solved the problem yet' he reported, despondent.\n",
    "His instructor replied, 'Oh I assumed you had died.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little \n",
    "or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest \n",
    "me in my home town, I thought I would travel about a little \n",
    "and see the learned part of the world. \n",
    "In due course I arrived at Caltech where I had the privilege of attending \n",
    "Professor Apostol's lectures as part of my Freshman curriculum. \n",
    "In keeping with the institute's\n",
    "culture of irreverence, my fellow classmates and I referred to \n",
    "Tom Apostol as '*Tommy*'. I see him in my mind's \n",
    "eye standing before the blackboard in Noyes Laboratory, \n",
    "all business as he begins a lecture on a version\n",
    "of calculus more rigorous than what I had seen in highschool. \n",
    "At some point he would suddenly make an impossible, \n",
    "outrageous mathematical claim. There would follow a pause\n",
    "while he let this claim sink in... one might scoff quietly... \n",
    "and then Professor Apostol would continue by making the portentous \n",
    "remark, \"Now nobody can stop me from *making this claim*...\".\n",
    "Then there would be another pause... do you see it?... and then\n",
    "a logical argument would follow step by step, at the end of \n",
    "which this ridiculous claim was shown to be quite reasonably true. \n",
    "As Freshmen we did not always appreciate the fun of this style\n",
    "of narrative. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in retrospect I \n",
    "appreciate Tommy's lecture style. He happily carried the\n",
    "burden of justifying his results, not resorting to the phrase\n",
    "of convenience 'it turns out that...' Furthermore his tempo\n",
    "of delivery always gave one a sense of forging ahead. \n",
    "Better keep up!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent of this notebook is to circle back \n",
    "and start over with Tommy on a new topic, namely analytic\n",
    "number theory. It would be a kindness to describe my history with \n",
    "real and complex analysis as 'patchy at best' so I have developed a\n",
    "strategy for getting by, and more on this shortly. \n",
    "We begin number theory -- I claim, and nobody can stop me from\n",
    "making this claim -- on some fateful day in \n",
    "grade school when we learn what a prime number is, usually\n",

    "I have no pretention of mathematical talent \n",
    "but I have spent enough time trying to solve math problems to conclude \n",
    "that an honest try is worth a shot and that getting help is no \n",
    "big deal. Getting help is certainly a more pleasant option than staring \n",
    "at a problem for a year. Two persons (at least) have preceded me in \n",

    "I was back in the ordinary world where falling has painful\n",
    "consequences. The dichotomy: Is the world ordinary or extraordinary?\n",
    "This was built into the impermanent nature of the books that argued the latter. \n",
    "Dinosaurs and the Red Queen were real only as long as the book lasted.\n",
    "The dinosaur story ended with the word 'extinct' and Alice eventually\n",
    "woke up to find the Red Queen was merely an inert chess piece. \n",
    "As a young person I began to hope that the fantastical world of\n",

    "of suspended disbelief built into reading a book. \n",

    "the insight offered by Martin Gardner: \n",
    "In the pages of Scientific American \n",
    "at monthly intervals there appeared these marvelous flashes\n",
    "in the *Mathematical Games* column. Here was something very much\n",
    "like the world of the Red Queen: Mr. Gardner invited readers\n",
    "to climb up onto the mantle above the fireplace and peer\n",
    "into the Looking Glass room. Then as the mirror dissolved in\n",
    "a mist we were further invited to pass through and climb\n",
    "back down. Here ideas mattered in proportion to their strangeness.\n",
    "We learned from his bemused tour guide voice about logic puzzles, \n",
    "paradoxes, prisoners both clever and unfortunate, inward-exploding \n",
