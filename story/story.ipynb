    "it was a momentous event; a Long Expected Party of great important,\n",
    "for one does not turn\n",
    "18 every day you should know.\n",
    "Everyone had taken extra special care to travel to the port town, \n",
    "and had taken special care to arrive on time. \n",
    "Some of the guests were faces familiar, as happens in small towns,\n",
    "while other guests she had not heard from in quite some while. \n",
    "Of course the celebration was to be held at Fyz Byzkyn's farmhouse; \n",
    "and Kid Pipkin being a considerate soul had showed up well in \n",
    "advance to help with preparations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'Oh I'm so glad you came early' said Fyz Byzkyn as she walked in the door. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Kid Pipkin stepped outside and across to the water trough but found only \n",
    "a nine and a five gallon container. She turned on the spigot but then what?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back into the house she remarked 'Your horses seemed in very good spirits, Kitty Dawn particularly.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'Yes I'm not surprised' said Fyz Byzkyn, 'I got in a load of fresh hay \n",
    "from the fields yesterday... and I think she has been teaching the others \n",
    "to nibble blackberries at the fence now those have come in. \n",
    "July has just flown by!'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a knock at the door, and Kid Pipkin went to welcome... \n",
    "who would it be? In fact it proved to be Alebasi, recently escaped and \n",
    "on the lam from the law once again. She was sporting a lovely diamond \n",
    "necklace that contrasted fabulously with her t-shirt and torn jeans.  \n",
    "Further up the drive walked Abcdef Ghijklmno Pqrstuvwxyz together with\n",
    "Zyxwvutsr Qponmlkji Hgfedcba, hand in hand. They had stepped away from \n",
    "their easels at the beach and flown in to celebrate the occasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon they were joined by Curious George walking up with the Man with \n",
    "the Yellow Hat. The Man With The Yellow hat does not speak in this story, \n",
    "for as was his custom he was present primarily to protect Curious George \n",
    "from harm, and Curious George will not be at any risk except\n",
    "perhaps of a sugar overdose. But the Man with the Yellow Hat does smile \n",
    "a great deal and he enjoys being a part of everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not far behind them came Horst Borskin deep in conversation with George \n",
    "Dyson. Horst Borskin seemed very upset about something so Kid Pipkin was pleased that he was having a lovely day. And as her eyes swept the \n",
    "gathered throng -- for by now it was a smallish throng -- Kid Pipkin \n",
    "found herself moved by how familiar and how beloved these people all were. \n",
    "Years had passed by but it seemed to have not had the slightest effect: \n",
    "Everyone was chattering away and laughing as if they were picking up \n",
    "from conversations of this morning or just the day before. \n",
    "\n",
    "The doorbell rang again and this time it was the girl with the skirt of \n",
    "many different colors, the skirt in variegated shades of orange, and as she\n",
    "made her entrance finally behind her it was Put Bunkin (whose real name \n",
    "was Bisaella, and whose *real* real name was Isabella) carrying a rather\n",
    "large box. She was still Mayor at this time and I am afraid we do not find \n",
    "out what was in the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon they sat down to supper (for it was early afternoon), \n",
    "a meal prepared by Fyz Byzkyn in a flurry of smoke and odors mysterious\n",
    "and slightly burnt-smelling wafting out from the kitchen. \n",
    "The order of events of this meal was peculiar by ordinary standards, \n",
    "to put it mildly: First Fyz Byzkyn brought out a birthday cake with 18 \n",
    "candles burning away, and George Dyson waved a hand and suddenly all the\n",
    "little flames were connected together by little beams of light, making\n",
    "a graph. Then according to custom they all sang Happy Birthday (though Zyxwvutsr sang it backwards) before Kid Pipkin made a wish\n",
    "and blew the candles out. The little edges tumbled up to the ceiling in\n",
    "the smoke and vanished. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The cake proved to be an Inverse Cake with three very thick layers of \n",
    "frosting separated by thin slivers of cake, and with more cake \n",
    "formed in a cylinder around about the outside and a disc of cake \n",
    "capping the top. Fyz Byzkyn seemed so pleased with \n",
    "his invention that nobody offered the observation that a cake made \n",
    "mostly of frosting was a bit on the rich side. \n",
    "And Curious George didn't mind anyway. \n",
    "After cake was finished it was time for the main course \n",
    "(crab-stuffed mushrooms with salmon-stuffed brussels sprouts), \n",
    "and then a salad and at last a series of appetizers which all seemed \n",
    "to involve pesto in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is much like the Backwards Suppers they would feed us\n",
    "in the dreadful Army\" griped Horst Borskyn with a sour look and a \n",
    "disapproving shake of his head. \n",
    "As usual nobody had any idea what Horst Borskyn was talking about, \n",
    "particularly as he had never served in any Army... so they merely nodded \n",
    "and looked thoughtful. But then unexpectedly, after a minute or so \n",
    "of silence had passed by after this remark, \n",
    "a gleam of triumph appeared in Fyz Byzkyn's eyes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh ho\" he began, clearly enjoying this moment beyond measure, \n",
    "\"this meal is not *like* a Backwards Dinner, Horst Borskyn,\n",
    "it ***is***\" (and here he drew out the word 'is' for about ten seconds) \n",
    "\"...a Backwards Dinner\" whereupon he burst out laughing. Once he had \n",
    "wiped some tears of joy away he continued \"...and now I\n",
    "should like to ask, How did you enjoy the Backwards Supper, \n",
    "Kid Pipkin??\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overcome, Kid Pipkin searched for a moment for a suitably eloquent response...\n",
    "but what she managed was \"Why yes of course it was ever so much the \n",
    "most splendid birthday supper I have ever had, and the best you\n",
    "have ever cooked!'\" with a smile spreading across her face. A little awkward\n",
    "perhaps but she meant every word. Then just as suddenly her countenance fell.  Everyone grew quiet and she continued in a small voice '...I only wish we \n",
    "could begin with this backwards supper and keep going backwards in time\n",
    "just ever so quickly to the days when I met you all, so many years ago, \n",
    "so that we might go out upon our adventures all over again.'\n",
    "And her eyes began shedding great tears. \n",
    "Nobody spoke but they all stood up and gathered about her and \n",
    "arms reached out to create a group hug that was \n",
    "the biggest group hug any of them could remember, \n",
    "and there was a great deal of sniffling and \n",

    "more than anyone can ever know, and you are simply stepping forward, further in, further on. And what is more,\n",
    "we are, in this room, none of us, real. We are ideas, we are archetypes, emotions, emblems, symbols; \n",
