    "who were completely new to coding and tier 2 was oriented towards students who \n",
    "already had some coding experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this most recent year the distinction was abandoned because it tended to \n",
    "dilute our limited teaching resources. The new assumption tried in 2023 was \n",
