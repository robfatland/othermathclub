# The Fine Print

The introduction to this book lays out the program. Here I will talk about some of the details.



## The realness of an idea


Let's pursue trolls a little bit more. We are fairly sure that we could walk
the length of this earth and never come upon an actual living troll. But we will
definitely find paintings of them, stories about them, even statues and other
sculptures of trolls. So the idea of trolls is certainly a real thing. It is
something we can agree upon and discuss late into the night.


What about a seven-dimensional box? The paper or the screen I am typing on
is flat: Two dimensional. The room I occupy has three physical dimensions.
When it comes to four spatial dimensions, however: That is an idea that 
comes up because I know the number after three is four. But I do not have
any experience of four dimensions. And if I try and use something else 
like 'time' as a fourth dimension: I run into the same obstacle if I choose
five or six or seven or more dimensions. 


The story of the Fishing Kid could happen in real life. It takes advantage
of a little finesse, that the silly rule about what you can bring on the
bus does not concern 'longest dimension' but rather 'implicit dimension'
so that the bus driver is mollified by the structure of the moving box. 
But notice that the story takes an unexpected turn at the end into boxes
in higher dimensions. This is where a subtle point comes up: Does the 
*idea* of a 27-dimensional box mean such a box can be built? No. Does 
the *idea* of a 27-dimensional box exist? Certainly, just as ideas about
trolls exist. Is it a useful idea? Well the idea of trolls is very useful
because trolls make for excellent adversaries in stories.
