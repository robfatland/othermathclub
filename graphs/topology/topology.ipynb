    "possible. But: If the side walks end at other vertices of $W$ they give those vertices\n",
    "an odd degree; which is again not allowed. Therefore there are no such possible side walks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize this last part: The logical combination of $W$ being the longest possible \n",
