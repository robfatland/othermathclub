## Egon is stumbling home in bluing and rags


Egon is a painter and a central character. His full name is Egon 'Fyz' Byzkn.
He is fictional.
It must also be said of Egon that while he does not have a wealth of initiative,
he does have extraordinary perseverence. Once he gets an idea in his head 
he will keep after it, for much longer than most people would. Egon has a friend named 
Allebasi 'Kyd' Pypkn. She is rather the opposite
of Egon in some ways: She has a wealth of ideas and initiative but 
she tends to appear rather busy,
particularly busy with her homework... to be honest she can be a little impatient.


Most mornings around 9:30 or so Egon and Kyd have coffee in the piazza, the public square 
at the center of the town where they live, a town called Monte Carlo. 


One evening Egon is stumbling home (he is rather uncoordinated, more so in the later stages
of the evening) when he passes a restaurant. Really it is a pub; but they serve curry with 
rice. In this pub there is a television, and the television shouts at Egon as he walks by:  
'... Something Something Something Binomial Theorem Something Something!!' says the television.
Egon ignores the television, continues walking, arrives home and falls asleep.


The next morning Egon sits across from Kyd at an al fresco cafe in the piazza. 
She seems to be working on a homework problem that involves writing many rows 
of zeros across a piece of paper. Egon clears his throat.

'A television said "Binomial Theorem" at me last night", observes Egon. "Do you have any notion of what 
that means?"


"Certainly!" responded Kyd. She writes down on a fresh sheet of paper ${( \alpha  +  \beta )}^n$.


Egon stares at this for a moment. "What is the $\alpha$ you have here?"


"Oh that's the beauty of the binomial theorem: $\alpha$ can be anything you like. This is not about $\alpha$."


Egon blinks... and stares for a few more moments. "And $\beta$? I suppose $\beta$ can be anything as well?"


"Of course!" responded Kyd. "Now you're getting the hang of it!"


Egon makes a nonplussed face that slowly becomes a dogged face; and he continues: 'Is $n$ also not important
and also anything I like as well?' 


'Oh no no no no' she replies. $n$ is important. Today, in this conversation, 
$n$ is a positive integer... or zero. So $n$ is zero or 1 or 
2 or 3 or 4... and so on like that.'


'So $\alpha$ is anything, $\beta$ is anything, they don't matter, this is not about them, and $n$ is 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on.'


'You got it.'


Why is there no *equal* sign? Isn't this math? I recall there was supposed to 
be an *equal* sign lurking about somewhere when it was math... mind you this was some time ago.'


'Yes there is an equals sign, if you like.'


'Well so what is on the other side of the equals sign?' asks Egon. 


Kyd Pypkn finishes writing another row of zeros on her homework -- this time there 
are a few ones as well -- and she says,
'Well suppose $n$ is 2. Then you have $\alpha + \beta$ squared, and this ***equals*** 
$\alpha^2 + 2 \cdot \alpha \cdot \beta + \beta^2$.'


'Ok I see $\alpha$ here on the left... squared... and I see it in the middle... but where did $\alpha$ go 
in this third part on the right where we have the $\beta^2$?' asks Egon.


'Oh it is still there; but it is raised to the zero power... so that makes it 1 and we do not bother writing it down.'


'Ah', said Egon, his eyebrows going up, '...so then a really complete version of this is ...' 
and he writes:


$$
(\alpha \quad + \quad \beta)^2 \quad \large{=} \quad 1 \cdot \alpha^2 \cdot \beta^0 \quad + \quad 2 \cdot \alpha \cdot \beta \quad + \quad 1 \cdot \alpha^0 \cdot \beta^2
$$


'Yes, just so,' said Kid Pipkin. 'And the result changes if you make $n$ something else than 2 to something else.'
