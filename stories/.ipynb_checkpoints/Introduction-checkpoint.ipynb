    "Question: Have you ever read a book about a *seemingly* ordinary world\n",
    "when suddenly the rules change? Perhaps it was a book about Harry Potter...\n",
    "for me it was books that featured animals who could speak English.\n",
    "In the first of these I teetered on the edge of a rabbit hole and then tumbled down \n",
    "in slow motion past cupboards containing jars of marmalade. How peculiar!\n",
    "So let us consider finding oneself in a new world within a book. \n",
    "This new world is built mostly from echoes of the \n",
    "ordinary world together with bits of the extraordinary and amazing...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is inspired by such books.\n",
    "There are, however, two important differences between those books and this one.\n",
    "First, when you set down\n",
    "those other books (it is late and time to go to sleep or perhaps you have finished\n",
    "reading the last page): You return to the real, ordinary world where rabbits\n",
    "do not check their watches and trolls do not turn to stone with the sunrise. \n",
    "In this book: Everything is real so nothing resets back to ordinary when\n",
    "you set this book down. This book is about *extraordinary* things\n",
    "but we insist that they are all *real* extraordinary things.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second difference is that you are a decider in this book. In a story book\n",
    "when the author writes 'There are trolls under the bridge...' then you agree \n",
    "that that is how it is; and you picture a bridge with some trolls beneath it.\n",
    "In *this* book about the *extraordinary* but *real* you must decide if you \n",
    "agree. You can say 'I don't buy it!' at any point you like. So now the author\n",
    "(who is me) is inviting you to disagree... by thinking about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It may help to find a bit of blank paper and a pencil. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the deal this book offers: I will do my best \n",
    "to convey the extraordinary, and you do your best to think about it using\n",
    "your imagination and a pencil and paper... but you must think **slowly**. \n",
    "If you focus your mind, slowly, on\n",
    "something that is extraordinary... and you keep focusing\n",
    "on it... and gradually it comes into focus... and you come to understand it... \n",
    "then *you* become *more extraordinary*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is my secret: This book is about becoming more extraordinary.\n",
    "You are extraordinary to begin with, for so many reasons. \n",
    "But the good news about this world is\n",
    "that there is always room to discover more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with the story of a metal pole.\n",

    "## The Fishing Kid must morph into a more solid example, literally... loh\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once upon a time there was a kid who wished to go fishing... but she did not \n",
    "have a fishing pole. She did manage to find a five foot steel pipe and (as\n",
    "she did not realize fishing poles are supposed to be very bendy) she decided \n",
    "the metal pipe would be her fishing pole. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "She gathered up some string and made a hook from a \n",
    "paper clip and grabbed a bag of cheese puffs to use as bait. She put five dollars\n",
    "in her pocket from her savings and she walked to the nearby bus stop to wait for\n",
    "the bus. When it arrived she paid her bus fare (one dollar) and rode the bus\n",
    "for 45 minutes to a bridge across a river. The bus driver did not seem to be \n",
    "paying her any attention... but he looked rather surprised at the pipe \n",
    "when she left the bus. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As she walked towards the bridge she passed a post office. A sign out front \n",
    "advertised cubical moving boxes, so many feet on a side. A small one foot cubical \n",
    "moving box cost $1, a two foot box cost $2, and so on up to five feet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "She continued on and made her way down to the banks of the river that flowed under\n",
    "the bridge. (It was called the D'enigmes River.)  She began fishing, a cheese puff\n",
    "skewered on the paper clip hook, attached to the metal pole by the string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, not a lot happened. Time passed. Minutes stretched to hours and\n",
    "never a bite from a fish, not even a nibble... and the cheese puffs would become\n",
    "soggy and fall off the hook and drift away. She decided to give up; and she \n",
    "returned to the bus stop near the river slightly disappointed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The bus pulled up but this time the driver was paying attention. As the girl began\n",
    "to board the bus driver said, 'No no no, I'm sorry but you may not bring anything\n",
    "on the bus longer than three feet. That metal pole is certainly five feet long.' \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now she is in a dilemma. She does not want to abandon her fishing pole... but the \n",
    "bus is her only way home. What should she do?\n",
