## Skill tiers


The Python Bytes (non-competitive) computing club has run each year at Tyee
Middle School in Bellevue Washington from 2018 onward. Until last year (the 2023-24 
school year) the club placed students into two 'tiers': Tier 1 was intended to 
serve students who were completely new to coding and tier 2 was oriented towards 
students who already had some coding experience. 


In this most recent year the distinction was abandoned because it tended to 
dilute our limited teaching resources. It also broke up friends (which they
do not enjoy) and it deprived the tier 1 students of potential help in
learning the material from their peers. The new assumption for 2023 was 
that all students who join the club are essentially beginning coders. 
This helps in the club's shift to a focus on ideas, described below.

## Language dichotomy


We learn a languages on multiple levels; and let's suppose we are 
motivated by some need to communicate so all those levels are important.
Python as a programming language follows this pattern; so the challenge in
the club is to combine motivating ideas with learning the mechanics of coding. 
With a limited club time of 75 minutes per week this challenge is very
acute.


Let's assume that details of Python syntax are going to be picked up the 
students along the way. We are now free to shift emphasis to ideas and ask:
What kinds of ideas will translate to a good learning experience? 
An example of one such idea is given at the top in the story of Ms. Halfway.





This problem has three great features. First we can act it out in the classroom. 
Second it can be solved mathematically. And third it can be simulated using
a small amount of Python code. This is the basis 

## Teaching approach


Middle school students do not (with some exceptions) have the perseverence 
to simply learn `print` and `while` and so on. Here are some approaches to 
leading the process.


- code along: Instructor writes code on the whiteboard, student copies.
Explanations as we go. Good to get started and get a working result.
Does not get the students self-sufficient
- solve this challenge: Instructor gives a problem to solve by writing code.
This might be a many-steps process. Interactively determine what commands
to use. Students help one another: The one who gets it first becomes the expert.
- Socratic: Instructor chooses a student, asks them a high-level question.
Example: "Where does Ms. Halfway end up?" Assuming the student is not sure
of the answer, we get to quiz this student and perhaps other students on
small steps to eventually build the code to give an answer. Very important:
There is no coding until the algorithm is understood. 


## Originating from ideas
