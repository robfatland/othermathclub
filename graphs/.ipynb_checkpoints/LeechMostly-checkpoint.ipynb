    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each edge of a tree can be assigned a *weight* which, for example a number. You could just as easily make this\n",

    "length' so this is a new thing we are adding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that trees are connected and they do not contain any cycles or loops. There is therefore one and only one \n",

    "Herbert Taylor published a proof that any Leech tree must have a number of vertices $n$ which is either a perfect \n",
    "square or a perfect square plus two. Notice that the perfect squares are 0, 1, 4, 9, 16 so that the allowed number\n",
    "of vertices in a Leech tree must be one of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 16, 18, 25, 27, ... and \n",
    "so on. The proof does not establish whether such Leech trees exist; only that if they do exist then \n",
    "their number of vertices will be one of these numbers. To put it another way: It is impossible to construct\n",
    "a Leech tree with 17 vertices because 17 is neither a perfect square nor a perfect square plus two.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going any further let's sketch out the proof so that you can try it on your own. You may begin working\n",

    "- All edge weights are integers, are therefore even or odd\n",

    "#### A Computational Analysis of Leech Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Leech trees with more than six vertices may or may not exist. One question we can ask at this point is 'Can\n",
    "we teach a computer to search for Leech trees?' The answer certainly 'yes' but we might be looking for a needle\n",
    "in an impossibly large haystack. It would be a good idea (before writing the program) to estimate just how \n",
    "big that haystack is.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the five known Leech trees have 2, 3, 4, 4, and 6 vertices. These are all allowed numbers of vertices\n",
    "so it is a relief that this is consistent with Herbert Taylor's result! Let's consider a Leech tree with 16 vertices \n",
    "since L.Szekely determined (using a computer) that there are no Leech trees with 9 or 11 vertices. How long would\n",
    "it take to search all possible trees with 16 vertices? Well such a tree will have 15 edges but we can begin by\n",
    "constructing a \"necessary tree\" of three vertices o--------o--------o. (We don't know the weights yet but\n",
    "more on this in a little bit.) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have two edges so we must place 13 additional edges.\n",
    "Once these edges are placed we will have path sums 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 120 since 16 choose 2 is 120. \n",
    "One of the edge weights will have to be 1\n",
    "and another will have to be 2 and a third will have to be 4. We don't have to have an edge with weight 3 because\n",
    "this can be done by placing the 1 and 2 edges next to one another. But the weights must be unique so the only\n",
    "way to get a path sum of 4 is to have a single edge with weight 4. We can continue to think about rules for\n",
    "the weights but let's pause on that for a moment just to arrive at a first estimate of the problem size. \n",
    "\n",
    "After 1, 2 and 4 there remain 12 more edge weights remaining to determine.\n",
    "If we use 3 and then manage use the 10 consecutive integers larger than 4: 5, 6, 7, ..., 14 then we notice that\n",
    "the very last path with path sum 120 would imply 106 as a maximum edge weight. If it were any greater it would \n",
    "connect along some path to the 14-weight edge and give a path sum greater than 120, not permitted. So the\n",
    "edge weights are in the range $[1, 104]$. \n",
