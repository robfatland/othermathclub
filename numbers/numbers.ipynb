    "For $11$ sure enough the alternating sum works: $1-1=0$ and that is divisible by 11 since *any* number divides into zero\n",
    "zero times with zero remainder.\n",
    "It is the same for $22$ and $33$ and so on up until I hit $209$.\n",
    "That is: The alternating sum of digits was always $0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I sat back and spent some time thinking about other numbers and the alternating sums of their digits. \n",

    "\n",

    "In fact: From here on everything is going to work out great. I have been lucky twice: First because I already \n",

    "was a good one. Elsewhere in this library I will describe wrong guesses that lead down blind alleys; but in\n",
    "this case I got lucky in this way at the outset.\n",
