## Egon is stumbling home in bluing and rags


Egon is a painter and a central character of this chapter.  
The thing that needs to be said of Egon is that while he does not have a great deal of initiative,
he does have the admirable quality of perseverence. Once he gets an idea, he will keep pursuing it
for much longer than most people. Also he has a friend named Kidpip; who is quite the opposite
of Egon. She has a wealth of ideas but she always seems rather busy... so she often seems a 
bit impatient. 


One evening Egon was stumbling home (he is rather uncoordinated, more so in the late evening) when
he passes by a restaurant. Really it is a pub; but they serve curry sometimes. In the pub is a television,
and the television shouted at Egon '... something something something Binomial Theorem!!! something something'
He perseveres, however, and arrives home and falls asleep.
