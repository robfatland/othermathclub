    "## A progression to a claimed solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Early attempts operated on randomly generated rings. \n",
    "The metrics I tried invariably failed in my view:\n",
    "They were not monotonic although they did tend to decrease to a minimum.\n",
    "This led to experimenting with simpler (binary) rings.\n",
    "I also refined the code to look more carefully at ring behavior resulting from flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This led to the \n",
    "second and third programs to do exhaustive recursive searches forward and backward respectively.\n",
    "These experiments made it clear that while ring flips could be chosen from among\n",
    "negative sites, nevertheless the initial ring was a vertex in a rigid directed graph of all \n",
    "rings. This di-graph has multiple paths to a particular ring, some intrinsic degeneracy. \n",
    "In a path graph the number of edges departing some $R$ equals the number of negative numbers \n",
    "found in $R$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In passing it became apparent that the $n$ equivalent versions of $Q$ would correspond to $n$\n",
    "permutations of any ring $R$ under rotation of indices.\n",
    "The reverse-flip graph originating from $Q$ generates all possible $R_n$ (with perhaps a\n",
    "rotation of indices needed). In contrast the exhaustive graph of all possible forward-flips \n",
    "on some initial $R$ produce only a small subset of those \n",
    "rings en route to $Q$. It would be interesting to visualize this with NetworkX.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A key useful idea was to look at the flip sum in the path from $R$ to $Q$. This idea applied to \n",
    "simple rings (particularly binaries) finally provided enough information to guess a workable \n",
    "metric; particularly because the flip sum $f$ appeared to be constant regardless of flip site\n",
    "choices. This guess is the basis for the partial solution to the problem given below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For $n=3$ the ring is simple enough to allow us to guess $f(R)$: \n",
    "It is twice the absolute value of the sum of neighbor-products. \n",
    "That is, suppose a 3-site ring has values $a$, $b$ and $c$. Then \n",
    "$f\\;=\\;2 \\left| {ab+bc+ca} \\right|$. Also I found that at a given \n",
    "depth in the tree, $f$ varies from one $R$ to another; so the \n",
    "constancy of $f$ is related to ring configuration more than \n",
    "'number of flips to $Q$'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The $q$ function is to my surprise $\\frac{2f}{b}$ for binary rings.\n",
    "Extending this leads to the solution given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integer space idea \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see a ring as a series of $n-1$ integers with arbitrary sum followed by a final \n",
    "integer chosen to give the ring a total sum of $1$. This is an $n-1$-dimensional space of integers\n",
    "where we can look for extremal values of a metric defined on that space. This idea is related to the \n",
    "notion that for a fixed $n$ the set of possible ring paths is a directed graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be interesting to point out that a bead on a wire loop is a two-dimensional \n",
    "structure in a three dimensional space that has only one dynamic dimension, the bead's\n",
