    "### Call And Response Teaching\n",
    "\n",
    "We want teaching to be interactive; and this means often asking a question or giving a\n",
    "directive and getting back an answer or an action. Let's call this call-response teaching, \n",
    "in contrast to lecturing or transmit-receive teaching. The big picture goal is this: We \n",
    "inhabit a complex and wonderful 'next world' whereas the students are in a less complex,\n",
    "less wonderful 'this world'... and we are train conductors helping them travel across.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The number one counterproductive inclination we tend to have as teachers is to \n",
    "'push the point' with our students. What do I mean by this?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ask a question and then -- when the student does not respond -- provide the answer ourselves.\n",
    "* When the student delays in answering: Rush to add a leading question.\n",
    "* Tell a student what code to type in.\n",
    "* Pull the laptop over and write or edit code for the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushing the point is *intervening* in the student's learning process before it completes.\n",
    "To be sure: Sometimes 'completes' does not mean 'arrives at the correct answer'. \n",
    "Let's articulate some completions in the learning process; in response to a question or\n",
    "a task that we provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The student knows the answer and provides it directly.\n",
    "* The student provides a partially incorrect answer.\n",
    "* The student struggles and eventually provides the answer.\n",
    "* The student answers confidently but incorrectly.\n",
    "* The student struggles to an incorrect answer.\n",
    "* The student is unable to arrive at an answer.\n",
    "* The student provides some related information that they feel more solid on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously we want the environment to be supportive. We establish early on and keep reinforcing that\n",
    "\"I don't know\" is a great answer. We rehearse with the students saying \"I am not sure but I know that...\"\n",
    "where they can state something they believe is relevant. These rules of response allow the student \n",
    "to complete the call-response process without the teacher providing an intervention. It is very \n",
    "hard not to intervene when we feel a sense of urgency. This is the \n",
    "second element of call-response, once we have established \"I don't know\" as a welcome answer. \n",
    "This second element is patience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An absurd example: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Teacher: Alright Phil, what is Planck's constant? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil: <pause> I do not know but I think it has something to do with pirates...\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Teacher: Excellent. And why pirates, exactly? Help me understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Phil: Pirates make you walk the plank.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Teacher: Excellent, thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "This brings us to how to proceed when the student does not immediately provide the correct \n",
    "response. We try to manage the classroom to balance two things: Making learning\n",
    "progress (challenge the students; they grow) with successful call-response experiences\n",
    " (reinforce the material through articulation). \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here are some approaches to following up incorrect responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- First: Go for an affirmative (see below *)\n",
    "- Second: Chart a new course\n",
    "    - The incorrect response is an indication that the material is not internalized yet\n",
    "    - Maybe the question needs to be re-stated\n",
    "    - Maybe the premise material needs to be repeated\n",
    "    - Maybe the next steps in the plan need to be altered / supplemented\n",
    "    - Maybe it is time for a break\n",
    "    - Maybe it is time for students to work together\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The counterpoint to 'patience' is 'repetition'.  It is very easy to view something we \n",
    "understand as easily understood by someone else. It is never a crime to tell a student\n",
    "something they already know. It validates and reinforces their understanding. Only when\n",
    "this happens to excess without checking in with the students on their level of engagement\n",
    "does the repetition process risk losing their attention. Again it is a balancing act.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The main point of this little essay is that patience and repetition are our most important\n",
    "skills to develop as teachers. This is difficult because we tend to teach things we find\n",
    "exciting and novel. We teach from the *next* world in the hope of sharing that world with\n",
    "the students living in *this* world. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Affirmative: Some type of encouraging, positive response that genuinely communicates to \n",
    "the student that their participation in call-response was the important thing, not whether\n",
    "they got the right answer. Often (for an incorrect response) the affirmative will pull out\n",
    "some word, phrase or concept in the incorrect response and emphasize it because it is \n",
    "resident in the correct response. An example: \n",
    "    \n",
    "Teacher: Phil how would you calculate a number half-way between two other numbers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Phil: I don't know; multiply the two numbers?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Teacher: Ok we're almost there: You are absolutely right in thinking that we \n",
    "connect them together using arithmetic. Let's try working an example using $2$ and $6$. "

    "home town of Monte Carlo. He places three paint cans on the ground as vertices of a very large \n",
    "(50 meter scale) triangle in the piazza. He begins at a random location and rolls a die to\n",
    "choose one of the three vertices. He then proceeds from where he stands towards the\n",
    "chosen vertex, stops at the halfway point, and paints a dot on the ground. He repeats \n",
    "this procedure a large number of times, each time choosing a new vertex at random.\n",
    "We might speculate on the nature of the resulting painting. We might make such a \n",
    "painting on a piece of paper if we have considerable perseverance. And we might do\n",
    "the same on a computer more quickly.\n",
