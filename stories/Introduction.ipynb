    "simply so. The author says: 'There are trolls here.' There it is. The agreed-upon rule is: \n",

    "In *this* book the difference is: Because the extraordinary claims to be real, \n",

    "\n",

    "What does it mean to think slowly? A chap named Daniel Kahneman\n",
    "describes thinking slowly in terms of how our brain deals with new information. \n",
    "He says that the new information starts out by making no sense to us. We could imagine it is\n",
    "kind of *blurry*. So we enter a slow-thinking trance where the new thing gradually gradually\n",

    "## The Fishing Kid\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once upon a time there was a kid who wished to go fishing... but she did not \n",
    "have a fishing pole. She did manage to find a five foot steel pipe and (as\n",
    "she did not realize fishing poles are supposed to be very bendy) she decided \n",
    "the metal pipe would be her fishing pole. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "She gathered up some string and made a hook from a \n",
    "paper clip and grabbed a bag of cheese puffs to use as bait. She put five dollars\n",
    "in her pocket from her savings and she walked to the nearby bus stop to wait for\n",
    "the bus. When it arrived she paid her bus fare (one dollar) and rode the bus\n",
    "for 45 minutes to a bridge across a river. The bus driver did not seem to be \n",
    "paying her any attention... but he looked rather surprised at the pipe \n",
    "when she left the bus. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As she walked towards the bridge she passed a post office. A sign out front \n",
    "advertised cubical moving boxes, so many feet on a side. A small one foot cubical \n",
    "moving box cost $1, a two foot box cost $2, and so on up to five feet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "She continued on and made her way down to the banks of the river that flowed under\n",
    "the bridge. (It was called the D'enigmes River.)  She began fishing, a cheese puff\n",
    "skewered on the paper clip hook, attached to the metal pole by the string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, not a lot happened. Time passed. Minutes stretched to hours and\n",
    "never a bite from a fish, not even a nibble... and the cheese puffs would become\n",
    "soggy and fall off the hook and drift away. She decided to give up; and she \n",
    "returned to the bus stop near the river slightly disappointed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The bus pulled up but this time the driver was paying attention. As the girl began\n",
    "to board the bus driver said, 'No no no, I'm sorry but you may not bring anything\n",
    "on the bus longer than three feet. That metal pole is certainly five feet long.' \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now she is in a dilemma. She does not want to abandon her fishing pole... but the \n",
    "bus is her only way home. What should she do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Realness of ideas: In pursuit of trolls\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are fairly sure that we could walk\n",
    "the length of this earth and never come upon an actual living troll. But we will\n",
    "definitely find paintings of them, stories about them, even statues and\n",
    "sculptures of trolls. The idea of trolls is a real thing; or else I\n",
    "could not write this sentence. Trolls we can argue and discuss late into the night.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about a twenty-seven-dimensional box? The paper or screen holding\n",
    "these words lies flat, has two dimensions. The bus I ride has three physical dimensions.\n",
    "What in my experience has four dimensions? \n",
    "Nothing! I do not have any experience of four dimensions. But I do know that \n",
    "shadows have one less dimension than what casts the shadow... so what\n",
    "does a three dimensional shadow of a four-dimensional object look like?\n",
    "And what about five or six or more dimensions? Let's suppose that, like for trolls,\n",
    "the idea is valid... does it lead to anything substantial?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin again. All zero-dimensional shaddows (dots) are produced by\n",
    "strings. This is not true but let's pretend it is true. If I see a \n",
    "one-dimensional shadow, a line segment, it is because someone is shining\n",
    "a light edge-on at a cookie sheet, which is two dimensions. Similarly \n",
    "a two dimensional shadow is produced by shining a light on a three dimensional\n",
    "object like a bust of Pallas. Therefore all three dimensional objects are\n",
    "shadows of four-dimensional objects. Ok granted this is an abuse of\n",
    "both language and logic but it arrives at a pleasant conclusion, that \n",
    "we live in a four-dimensional shadow world. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take a moment to discuss the story of the Fishing Kid. \n",
    "She has a Zebco telescoping fishing pole and a tackle box; and so \n",
    "she hops on the bus to go several miles to a nearby river to fish. \n",
    "When she departs from the bus she notices a nearby U-Haul moving\n",
    "store. Thinking not much of this fact she clambers down the bank\n",
    "and begins fishing. As she moves along the river she happens upon \n",
    "an abandoned metal bar that seems to be made of platinum. Realizing\n",
    "this could be quite valuable she picks it up and -- after having\n",
    "no luck with the fishing -- returns to he bus stop. The platinum bar\n",
    "is five feet long. \n",
    "\n",
    "loh\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really a comment on the premise of this book. The story of the \n",
    "Fishing Kid is presented in a manner that could actually happen. It uses\n",
    "a little finesse, that the silly bus driver's rule does not concern \n",
    "'longest dimension' but rather 'implicit dimension' of an object. But\n",
    "it is essentially a possible scenario. In contrast, the coda at the end \n",
    "of the story takes further liberties into boxes\n",
    "of higher dimension. The idea is real even if building such boxes \n",
    "is beyond our present skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A sharp turn into uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense the *uncertain* and the *familiar* are opposites. So what\n",
    "is meant by *familiar uncertainty*? Subjects presented \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for open-ended endings comes from research,\n",

    "unanswered questions. Here too is a paradox; because most any answer \n",
    "research arrives at suggests, even leads inexorably towards more questions.\n",
    "Research is the business of mostly not knowing, of mostly living \n",
    "in uncertainty and doubt, of living with a bewildering lack of \n",
    "comprehension. Hence for a person engaged in research, *uncertainty*\n",
    "becomes *familiar*. Sometimes the process brings us a great \n",
    "discovery. When this happens the satisfaction of answering a\n",
    "deep question can motivate us to press forward. But in many\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a contestant on a game show. The host (Monty Hall) shows you three boxes, only one of which\n",
    "has a prize hidden inside. You are allowed to choose one of the boxes. Before its contents are revealed\n",
    "Monty Hall first opens a different box under which (he knows) there is no prize. Now there are two\n",
    "un-revealed boxes: The one you chose and the other un-revealed box. Monty now offers you the opportunity\n",
    "to switch your choice to the other box. What should you do? That is: What is your best strategy assuming\n",
    "you want to win the prize?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Emily:\n",
    "Your probability of choosing correctly at the start is clearly 1 in 3. Think of two swimming pools of size 1/3\n",
    "and size 2/3. You are now sitting in the swimming pool of size 1/3 and the other two boxes are in the other larger\n",
    "swimming pool. We can agree that the numbers 1/3 and 2/3 represent the probabilities that the actual prize is in the\n",
    "two respective pools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the empty box in the 2/3 pool is revealed and discarded. You now have the opportunity to jump into that\n",
    "2/3 pool.  So do that... and now here is where it gets interesting. If after you\n",
    "jumped into the bigger pool you had to choose between the two boxes originally in that pool: You would have \n",
    "even chances of selecting the correct box, the one with the prize. That gets you back to a 1/3 chance.\n",
    "But Monty Hall has thrown out the wrong choice. You can't possibly make a mistake when you jump\n",

    "have our boots on) we shall go through this gate into a field and off into probability and geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deep problem to consider is the probability that three uniformly random segments (say 0 to 1 meters each) can \n",

    "circuitous [sic] path. So let's throw out the rationale needed for the problem and then come back and state this \n",
    "as not **ABA** but rather as **A B C C' D E A**, no kidding!\n",

    "Taking **A** as read. \n",
    "\n",
    "**B** We need to know the area of a triangle, regardless of its shape. This means any of its three sides can be considered\n",
    "the base and it is an argument based on subtraction of areas that is necessary for the general answer to be understood\n",
    "no matter how the triangle *leans over*. And notice the two in the denominator. \n",
    "\n",
    "**C** Now what about a triangular pyramid. Here we can suppose *area* of base times height, with a similar sort of \n",
    "process to cope with *leaning over*. But what is the denominator? Or why is it 3 instead of 2? Does this relate to \n",
    "dimension? Well yes, I claim it does. But why does dimension appear in the denominator? Incidentally there is a side\n",
    "branch where we imagine a four-dimensional pyramid by borrowing time. Time is not the fourth dimension in mathematics\n",
    "but Einstein borrowed that formalism of dimensio nand *used* time; so there we can make a cube melt uniformly and ask\n",
    "what is its time-volume; and does that have a denominator of 4? And yes it does. (I think.) \n",
    "\n",
    "**C'** Now there is a whole class of intermezzo problems concerning triangular pyramids with three faces that are \n",
    "right angles; of which two of those right triangle faces have integral sides. A tenuous link back to Diophantine.\n",
