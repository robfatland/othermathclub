# The Other Math Club and Python Bytes

# Python Bytes

Python Bytes (PB) is a middle school coding club that focuses on exploring
the relationship between ideas and computation. The operation of the club
has been a learning journey and these notes (written August 2024) attempt
to summarize aspects of that journey.


Before getting into the details of the club experience, I'd like to provide
a personal remark on motivation. Before I became aware of calculators and
computers (in late 1976) I was immersed in a personal drama: I could see 
an ordinary world around me, the world 'as it was' -- cars and notebooks and grocery stores --
but then occasionally I was getting hints and signs that there was more going on. 
And this *more going on* was not *magic* per se, like spells one reads about in 
fantasy books; but it had *similarities* to magic. Sometimes this world-beyond was 
clearly in sight: We had after all journeyed to the moon several times. And just as often 
I found evidence of *more going on* to be elusive, beyond my view. Perhaps
a mirror could in fact dissolve and one could step through to the room on the
other side. 


So I gradually developed a personal compass that would point towards the
*more going on* world. One of the big milestones was finding out about computers 
and programmable calculators. Another was discovering the Mathematical Games 
column in Scientific American. By the time these pieces were added in my
compass had a pretty clear label, and that label was **mathematics**. 


## Club history and skill tiers

The Python Bytes (non-competitive) computing club has run each year at Tyee
Middle School in Bellevue Washington since 2018. Until last year (the 2023-24 
school year) the club ran on two 'tiers': Tier 1 was intended to serve students 
who were completely new to coding and tier 2 was oriented towards students who 
already had some coding experience. 

In this most recent year the distinction was abandoned because it tended to 
dilute our limited teaching resources. The new assumption tried in 2023 was 
that all students are essentially beginning coders. This helped in the 
shift of focus to ideas, described below.


## Language dichotomy

We tend to learn languages on multiple levels and Python as a programming 
language follows this pattern. With limited time (90 minutes once per week)
PB must address the challenge of learning coding mechanics -- how does 
execution flow work? What is a variable? What is syntax? -- with content that
