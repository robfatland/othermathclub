## Introduction

The purpose of this page is to introduce an inverted pyramid of mathematical process.

## There is a hypothesis

...in social science that language determines thought. It may be a little circular since habits and customs are arguably tied
to language and these may in turn reflect necessities in thought patterns. 

Be that as it may let's take the idea a step past language to mathematics. We can admire the precision of mathematics
and thereby say 'the more i speak in terms of math the more precise my thinking'. This is a normative statement so it
might be best to begin with a few axioms and observations.

* Mathematics is taken to be the exploration and discovery of patterns through imagination and reason.

  * Observing: Western mathematics draws historically from the theory of numbers and could be seen as one possible landscape of many to follow the pattern definition. 
  
* Problems exist where our thinking / our language is insufficiently expressive or comprehensive. 

  * In this sense mathematics as language uses problems to advance rapidly in comparison to traditional human language. 
  
* Speaking in a normative sense ('what is desirable') we can take on the task of promoting mathematics as a structured willful act that creates opportunity and freedom for other people...

  * ...and that is a good and a desirable thing.
  
* Therefore consider a progression as acolyte from A to B to ... to N as a path: Growing as a mathematician enables one to better serve others.

  * ...and this again is a desirable thing.
  
## The progression

Solving problems that involve calculation might be '''A''', the first step in the progression of an acolyte mathematician.
