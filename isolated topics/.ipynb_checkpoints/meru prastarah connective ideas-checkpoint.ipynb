    "\n",
    "Graphs are initially defined as two sets where the second set is *additional information* about the first set. \n",

    "the founders of information theory; a branch of applied math built on probability and statistics and used for\n",
    "(among other things) making mobile phones work. Mobile phones I am told are very popular; so if you would like \n",
    "to have a lucrative career: Learn the mathematics of information theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs defined in the above way are rather abstract and hence not too exciting. One idea for making graphs \n",
    "come alive is to challenge a student to turn the definition into a picture. This might require a little bit\n",
    "of coaching. A second step in livening up graphs is to immediately begin converting other sorts of problems \n",
    "to graph representation. For example the problem of arriving at 4 gallons of water from a pool of water and two bottles\n",
    "(with no markings on them) with capacity 3 and 5 gallons respectively can be represented as a directed graph. \n",
    "It is directed because some of the transitions are not reversible. \n",
    "\n",
    "What else? Can every mathematical problem be represented as a graph? This seems unlikely. But: The Konigsberg \n",
    "bridge problem is amenable... others escape me at the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that as an opening volley on graphs there are of course many many branches leading \n",
    "off: Kozyrev-Grinberg, Euler's formula, projection of graphs onto spheres and other topological surfaces, \n",
    "derivation of platonic solids and some other degenerate forms, Hamiltonian cycles... Ross Honsberger's books are \n",

    "dice because 'die' does not scan well for me. I mention 'other degenerate forms' because they are a fine example\n",
    "of letting the math lead us to tangential solutions. Let me elaborate: The platonic solids arise from a formula\n",
    "by Euler about planar graphs and a constraint about symmetry. From these we get the graph version of polyhedral\n",
    "dice but we also get what amounts to a coin and a football. The coin and football are not platonic solids because\n",
    "they require some non-ideal dimensional shenanigans; but we are familiar with them and they *do* fall out of\n",
    "the equations. Anyway as a last fling here is that graph problems are intrinsically Diophantine; another branch. \n",

    "else face represent?' In my view it is the sort of thing that is self-evident and completely mysterious at the \n",

    "no matter how the triangle *leans over*. And notice the two in the denominator. \n",
    "\n",
    "**C** Now what about a triangular pyramid. Here we can suppose *area* of base times height, with a similar sort of \n",
    "process to cope with *leaning over*. But what is the denominator? Or why is it 3 instead of 2? Does this relate to \n",
    "dimension? Well yes, I claim it does. But why does dimension appear in the denominator? Incidentally there is a side\n",
    "branch where we imagine a four-dimensional pyramid by borrowing time. Time is not the fourth dimension in mathematics\n",
    "but Einstein borrowed that formalism of dimensio nand *used* time; so there we can make a cube melt uniformly and ask\n",
    "what is its time-volume; and does that have a denominator of 4? And yes it does. (I think.) \n",
    "\n",
    "**C'** Now there is a whole class of intermezzo problems concerning triangular pyramids with three faces that are \n",
    "right angles; of which two of those right triangle faces have integral sides. A tenuous link back to Diophantine.\n",
    "Now we are connecting spatial imagination with the formula to arrive at multi-step problems. NTS: (6, 10) and \n",
