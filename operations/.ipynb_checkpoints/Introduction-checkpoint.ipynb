    "First, when you set down\n",
    "those other books (because it is time to go to sleep or much worse because you have finished\n",
    "the last page) you know you are returning to the real and the ordinary world. \n",
    "This book, on the other hand, is not like that. Everything in this book is real, \n",

    "simply so. The author says: 'There are trolls here.' There it is. The agreed-upon rule is: \n",

    "In *this* book the difference is: Because the extraordinary claims to be real, \n",

    "\n",
    "If you have read this far: You are a good candidate for reading more of this book.\n",

    "What does it mean to think slowly? A chap named Daniel Kahneman\n",
    "describes thinking slowly in terms of how our brain deals with new information. \n",
    "He says that the new information starts out by making no sense to us. We could imagine it is\n",

    "Let us begin with a story about a Fishing Kid. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Fishing Kid\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once upon a time there was a kid who wished to go fishing... but she did not \n",
    "have a fishing pole. She did manage to find a five foot steel pipe and (as\n",
    "she did not realize fishing poles are supposed to be very bendy) she decided \n",
    "the metal pipe would be her fishing pole. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "She gathered up some string and made a hook from a \n",
    "paper clip and grabbed a bag of cheese puffs to use as bait. She put five dollars\n",
    "in her pocket from her savings and she walked to the nearby bus stop to wait for\n",
    "the bus. When it arrived she paid her bus fare (one dollar) and rode the bus\n",
    "for 45 minutes to a bridge across a river. The bus driver did not seem to be \n",
    "paying her any attention... but he looked rather surprised at the pipe \n",
    "when she left the bus. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As she walked towards the bridge she passed a post office. A sign out front \n",
    "advertised cubical moving boxes, so many feet on a side. A small one foot cubical \n",
    "moving box cost $1, a two foot box cost $2, and so on up to five feet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "She continued on and made her way down to the banks of the river that flowed under\n",
    "the bridge. (It was called the D'enigmes River.)  She began fishing, a cheese puff\n",
    "skewered on the paper clip hook, attached to the metal pole by the string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, not a lot happened. Time passed. Minutes stretched to hours and\n",
    "never a bite from a fish, not even a nibble... and the cheese puffs would become\n",
    "soggy and fall off the hook and drift away. She decided to give up; and she \n",
    "returned to the bus stop near the river slightly disappointed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The bus pulled up but this time the driver was paying attention. As the girl began\n",
    "to board the bus driver said, 'No no no, I'm sorry but you may not bring anything\n",
    "on the bus longer than three feet. That metal pole is certainly five feet long.' \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now she is in a dilemma. She does not want to abandon her fishing pole... but the \n",
    "bus is her only way home. What should she do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Realness of ideas: In pursuit of trolls\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are fairly sure that we could walk\n",
    "the length of this earth and never come upon an actual living troll. But we will\n",
    "definitely find paintings of them, stories about them, even statues and\n",
    "sculptures of trolls. The idea of trolls is a real thing; or else I\n",
    "could not write this sentence. Trolls we can argue and discuss late into the night.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about a twenty-seven-dimensional box? The paper or screen holding\n",
    "these words lies flat, has two dimensions. The bus I ride has three physical dimensions.\n",
    "What in my experience has four dimensions? \n",
    "Nothing! I do not have any experience of four dimensions. But I do know that \n",
    "shadows have one less dimension than what casts the shadow... so what\n",
    "does a three dimensional shadow of a four-dimensional object look like?\n",
    "And what about five or six or more dimensions? Let's suppose that, like for trolls,\n",
    "the idea is valid... does it lead to anything substantial?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin again. All zero-dimensional shaddows (dots) are produced by\n",
    "strings. This is not true but let's pretend it is true. If I see a \n",
    "one-dimensional shadow, a line segment, it is because someone is shining\n",
    "a light edge-on at a cookie sheet, which is two dimensions. Similarly \n",
    "a two dimensional shadow is produced by shining a light on a three dimensional\n",
    "object like a bust of Pallas. Therefore all three dimensional objects are\n",
    "shadows of four-dimensional objects. Ok granted this is an abuse of\n",
    "both language and logic but it arrives at a pleasant conclusion, that \n",
    "we live in a four-dimensional shadow world. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take a moment to discuss the story of the Fishing Kid. \n",
    "She has a Zebco telescoping fishing pole and a tackle box; and so \n",
    "she hops on the bus to go several miles to a nearby river to fish. \n",
    "When she departs from the bus she notices a nearby U-Haul moving\n",
    "store. Thinking not much of this fact she clambers down the bank\n",
    "and begins fishing. As she moves along the river she happens upon \n",
    "an abandoned metal bar that seems to be made of platinum. Realizing\n",
    "this could be quite valuable she picks it up and -- after having\n",
    "no luck with the fishing -- returns to he bus stop. The platinum bar\n",
    "is five feet long. \n",
    "\n",
    "loh\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really a comment on the premise of this book. The story of the \n",
    "Fishing Kid is presented in a manner that could actually happen. It uses\n",
    "a little finesse, that the silly bus driver's rule does not concern \n",
    "'longest dimension' but rather 'implicit dimension' of an object. But\n",
    "it is essentially a possible scenario. In contrast, the coda at the end \n",
    "of the story takes further liberties into boxes\n",
    "of higher dimension. The idea is real even if building such boxes \n",
    "is beyond our present skill.\n",

    "## A sharp turn into uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sense the *uncertain* and the *familiar* are opposites. So what\n",
    "is meant by *familiar uncertainty*? Subjects presented \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for open-ended endings comes from research,\n",
    "the pursuit of deeper understanding motivated by\n",
    "unanswered questions. Here too is a paradox; because most any answer \n",
    "research arrives at suggests, even leads inexorably towards more questions.\n",
    "Research is the business of mostly not knowing, of mostly living \n",
    "in uncertainty and doubt, of living with a bewildering lack of \n",
    "comprehension. Hence for a person engaged in research, *uncertainty*\n",
    "becomes *familiar*. Sometimes the process brings us a great \n",
    "discovery. When this happens the satisfaction of answering a\n",
    "deep question can motivate us to press forward. But in many\n",
    "cases it is the process of pursuit that keeps us going. Again\n",

    "\n",
    "You are a contestant on a game show. The host (Monty Hall) shows you three boxes, only one of which\n",
    "has a prize hidden inside. You are allowed to choose one of the boxes. Before its contents are revealed\n",
    "Monty Hall first opens a different box under which (he knows) there is no prize. Now there are two\n",

    "to switch your choice to the other box. What should you do? That is: What is your best strategy assuming\n",
    "you want to win the prize?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Emily:\n",
    "Your probability of choosing correctly at the start is clearly 1 in 3. Think of two swimming pools of size 1/3\n",
    "and size 2/3. You are now sitting in the swimming pool of size 1/3 and the other two boxes are in the other larger\n",
    "swimming pool. We can agree that the numbers 1/3 and 2/3 represent the probabilities that the actual prize is in the\n",
    "two respective pools.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now the empty box in the 2/3 pool is revealed and discarded. You now have the opportunity to jump into that\n",

    "jumped into the bigger pool you had to choose between the two boxes originally in that pool: You would have \n",
    "even chances of selecting the correct box, the one with the prize. That gets you back to a 1/3 chance.\n",
    "But Monty Hall has thrown out the wrong choice. You can't possibly make a mistake when you jump\n",

    "Diophantine analysis begins with a collection of farm animals. See chapter 2 of _Wheels, Life_ by Gardner; which connects\n",
    "to Fermat's Last; so of course this topic also connect very easily with the pythagorean formula since only certain right triangles give us three integral sides. Now let's throw off a branch into geometry, specifically area of triangles and\n",

    "have our boots on) we shall go through this gate into a field and off into probability and geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deep problem to consider is the probability that three uniformly random segments (say 0 to 1 meters each) can \n",
    "form a triangle. Coincidentally the solution I have in mind is built on understanding triangles but in a very\n",
    "circuitous [sic] path. So let's throw out the rationale needed for the problem and then come back and state this \n",
    "as not **ABA** but rather as **A B C C' D E A**, no kidding!\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking **A** as read. \n",
    "\n",
    "**B** We need to know the area of a triangle, regardless of its shape. This means any of its three sides can be considered\n",
    "the base and it is an argument based on subtraction of areas that is necessary for the general answer to be understood\n",
    "no matter how the triangle *leans over*. And notice the two in the denominator. \n",
    "\n",
    "**C** Now what about a triangular pyramid. Here we can suppose *area* of base times height, with a similar sort of \n",
    "process to cope with *leaning over*. But what is the denominator? Or why is it 3 instead of 2? Does this relate to \n",
    "dimension? Well yes, I claim it does. But why does dimension appear in the denominator? Incidentally there is a side\n",
    "branch where we imagine a four-dimensional pyramid by borrowing time. Time is not the fourth dimension in mathematics\n",
    "but Einstein borrowed that formalism of dimensio nand *used* time; so there we can make a cube melt uniformly and ask\n",
    "what is its time-volume; and does that have a denominator of 4? And yes it does. (I think.) \n",
    "\n",
    "**C'** Now there is a whole class of intermezzo problems concerning triangular pyramids with three faces that are \n",
    "right angles; of which two of those right triangle faces have integral sides. A tenuous link back to Diophantine.\n",

    "\n",
    "These project ideas require you to have a Python environment where you can do some serious work. You can\n",
    "work at cswonders.com if you like; or come and see the coaches about some other ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also before we begin: There is a lot here to read and think about. However if you would like to get started on \n",
    "the projects (there are three here) just skip down to where it says **Project 1** or **Project 2** or **Project 3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*'Chaos'* means crazy randomness and disorder in English; but in mathematics it has a more specific meaning. Chaos\n",
    "in math is based on the idea of a *dynamical system*. So what does this mean? A system for our purposes is an\n",
    "imaginative model; like something you might put together on a table top using some sticks and glue and pins and string\n",
    "and maybe an egg and a couple of metal weights and a little race car that you stole from your brother. So there is\n",
    "a vague idea of a *system* as some stuff brought together. And now to make it *dynamical* just means you set it \n",
    "up so that when you give it a push it does something interesting. It changes with time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know what a dynamical system is let's go back to chaos. A chaotic dynamical system is one that\n",
    "is very very difficult to predict what it will do. In fact what it does depends on how you set it up at the \n",
    "start; but very microscopic changes in how you set it up can produce wildly different end results. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what about fractals? Fractals are structures that are similar to themselves on different scales of size.\n",
    "If you took a stamp of a foot outline and using a bunch of stamping actions drew a picture of a foot: That \n",
    "is getting into the idea of fractals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now there is a strange thing about mathematics -- the study of patterns -- that chaos and fractals are connected\n",
    "together. And this has everything to do with the deep mysteries of the universe that we don't have time to explain \n",
    "here. But I did want to tell you just these few terms { 'chaos', 'dynamical system', 'mathematics', 'fractal' }\n",
    "so that you would have little buzzy wires with sparks coming out in your mind\n",
    "as you work on this project. If the word 'philosophy' means 'understanding of the universe' then supposing things \n",
    "are complicated we can't learn everything at once. Hamlet says...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Again: If you would like to get started on the project ideas (there are three here) just skip down to where it \n",
    "says **Project 1** or **Project 2** or **Project 3**. Or just keep reading. Next it is pirates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomness and Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with a story.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The town of Monte Carlo is located on the northwestern coast of \n",
    "the Mediterranean Sea. It is famous for its sunny weather, beautiful scenery and for \n",
    "gambling casinos where one can play games of chance like dice or roulette. Now as you know\n",
    "rolling a dice is a probability experiment: You never know in advance what will come up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One fine day a pirate named Sue who has been attending a party feels tired and returns to the harbor\n",
    "to fall asleep in her hammock on board her boat. She arrives at the wharf where\n",
    "her boat is secured. She sees it where she left it at the far end of the wharf. \n",
    "(A *wharf* goes out from shore and boats tie up to it.) This wharf is 21 steps wide and \n",
    "100 steps long; she she is 100 steps from her boat now. Unfortunately she banged her head on\n",
    "an anchor a moment ago. The anchor was secured to another boat and she didn't see it in the dark harbor. \n",
    "She is now quite dizzy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sue's boat is 100 steps away; so she begins walking.\n",
    "The problem is that (being terribly dizzy) after every step forward towards her ship \n",
    "she stumbles sideways: Either to her left or to her right: One step sideways at random. \n",
    "She must make 100 forward steps to reach her boat. However if she takes\n",
    "too many random steps to the left or to the right -- you see the problem -- she will tumble\n",
    "off the side of the wharf into the cold water.\n",
    "What is the probability she will make it safely to her ship at the far end of the \n",
    "wharf? Again: Sue starts at one end of the wharf centered left-right. She must go forward \n",
    "100 steps and if she ends up 11 steps to the right or left she falls off the edge\n",
    "of the wharf into the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first project idea here is to solve this problem using a computer to simulate her \n",
    "walk down the wharf. If you do it once she might make it; or she might fall off the side.\n",
    "This does not give you the answer 'what is the probability she makes it?' So think \n",
    "about this: What do you need to do in order to answer the probability question?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Egon\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please meet Egon, one of my personal heroes. He appears different to everyone who meets him; and for me he is \n",
    "a slightly crazy artist (with a beard) who lives in Monte Carlo. This part of my Monte Carly story is\n",
    "related to the previous one about the pirate except nobody is going to fall into \n",
    "the harbor. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Egon is a painter and a poet. He lives in an apartment in Monte Carlo near the center\n",
    "of town by the town square. This is a large flat plaza paved with bricks. Egon wishes to paint something \n",
    "on the bricks of the town square that somehow represents random chance so he ponders for some time. \n",
    "As he ponders Egon happens to notice there is a single dice in his beard. Egon rolls the dice; \n",
    "it comes up **4**. He keeps rolling; and of course each time he gets a number from one to six. \n",
    "Egon considers this and finally he hatches a plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Egon places three empty paint cans A, B and C in the town square to make a huge triangle\n",
    "- He steps over to the side of the town square away from his three empty paint cans\n",
    "- He rolls his dice: It is a **5**\n",
    "  - On a **5** or a **6** his rule is: Walk half-way to can **C** and paint a dot\n",
    "    - So Egon does just this. (He is carrying another can of paint and a brush.) \n",
    "- Egon has painted one dot so far...\n",
    "- He rolls his dice again: It is a **1**\n",
    "  - He walks half-way to paint can **A** and paints a dot\n",
    "    - He has now painted two dots\n",
    " - He rolls his dice again: It is a **1**\n",
    "   - He walks half-way *again* to can **A** and paints a dot\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can see that Egon can amuse himself for many many hours, even days, rolling his dice, walking half-way to \n",
    "one of his three paint cans **A**, **B**, or **C** and painting a dot. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The question for you is: What does the resulting painting look like? Feel free to think about this question for \n",
    "some time if you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a computer program to recreate Egon's painting. Since Egon uses a dice you may certainly use the Python random\n",
    "number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify your program from Project 2, for example: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Egon may select any number of paint cans to place out in the town square\n",
    "- Egon may choose a different \"percent\" of the distance to travel. Up above it was 50%, or half-way to the paint can. No reason this couldn't be 27% or 94% or even 212% or -71%\n",
    "- The paint cans could be placed evenly like the vertices of a regular polygon... or they could be placed randomly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully by the time you have completed these three projects you have improved your Python skills. Did you \n",
    "learn anything interested that relates to the idea of fractals? \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Bytes (non-competitive) computing club has run each year at Tyee\n",
    "Middle School in Bellevue Washington from 2018 onward. Until last year (the 2023-24 \n",
    "school year) the club placed students into two 'tiers': Tier 1 was intended to \n",
    "serve students who were completely new to coding and tier 2 was oriented towards \n",
    "students who already had some coding experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this most recent year the distinction was abandoned because it tended to \n",
    "dilute our limited teaching resources. It also sometimes divided friends \n",
    "(which they do not enjoy) and it deprived the tier 1 students of potential \n",
    "help in learning the material from their more experienced peers. In 2023 we \n",
    "ran with the idea focus and assumed all students are essentially beginning \n",
    "coders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting more advanced students engaged -- including the possibility of \n",
    "returning students as mentioned above -- goes to \"let's solve that problem \n",
    "if and when it comes up\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Language\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We learn a languages on multiple levels; and let's suppose we are \n",
    "motivated by some need to communicate so all those levels come together.\n",
    "Python as a programming language follows this pattern; so the challenge in\n",
    "the club is to combine motivating ideas with a process of learning the \n",
    "basics, the mechanics of coding. It is very challenging to do this in \n",
    "a limited club time of 75 minutes per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first idea or approach is to have the fundamentals clearly in mind\n",
    "as coaches so we can do little mini-lessons along the way. For example\n",
    "I remember that variables have three attributes, three things \n",
    "that makes them variables; and so when we first need\n",
    "variables I can \"call time out\" and do a little mini-lesson. It will\n",
    "come to me that I need to mention the three ingredients; so the students\n",
    "will be introduced to value, name and type. Then we can revisit this\n",
    "multiple times until it becomes second nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Teaching ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above we hope to begin with ideas that have nothing to do with\n",
    "computers or `print` statements. From there we want to think about them,\n",
    "try to understand them, and possibly we want to translate the ideas into\n",
    "some sort of calculation. Then and only then do we open our Python\n",
    "environment to begin writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our code works we can hopefully understand the idea better; or perhaps\n",
    "answer a question. In a spirit of exploration this is intended not as the\n",
    "end of the story but rather the starting point for further exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are five approaches to getting students writing useful code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- code along: Instructor writes code on the whiteboard, student copies.\n",
    "Explanations as we go. Good to get started and get a working result.\n",
    "Does not get the students self-sufficient\n",
    "- Do it yourself: The guide merely presents a coding objective.\n",
    "This might be a many-steps / iterative process. Interactively we may\n",
    "introduce or review certain commands. But the idea is the students are\n",
    "putting a program together under their own power. Students may work \n",
    "together or individually. Coaches try and help students avoid \"just copy\n",
    "what Fred does\".\n",
    "- Socratic: Instructor chooses a student, asks them a high-level question.\n",
    "Example: After introducing Ms. Halfway ask \"Where does she end up?\"\n",
    "Assuming the student is not sure of the answer: We resort to small leading\n",
    "questions directed to this student and to other students. By means of these\n",
    "small steps we eventually arrive at a plan for code that solves the problem.\n",
    "Very important: No coding until the algorithm is understood.\n",
    "- Kinesthetic: Activities away from the computer that enact some part of\n",
    "a source idea. These work well if there is some motion involved and if there\n",
    "is an opportunity to reach a non-obvious conclusion. Coaches aim for\n",
    "multiple iterations and as many participating students as possible. \n",
    "- Guide On The Side: A coach who is not the primary teacher circulates\n",
    "in the classroom and observes progress on screens. Suppose a student \n",
    "seems \"at pause\": The coach grabs a chair, places it nearby, and asks\n",
    "the student \"How is it going?\" From there the coach engages as seems\n",
    "appropriate to get the student off and running. The results of this \n",
    "process might turn into a \"common theme\" announcement for the room.\n",
