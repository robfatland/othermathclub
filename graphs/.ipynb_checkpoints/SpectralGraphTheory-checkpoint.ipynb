    "A slider-based experimentation space would be nice. For now I'll continue with static content.\n",
    "A graph $G$ is a pair of related sets $V$ and $E$ where$|V|=n$. The elements of $E$ are \n",
    "un-ordered pairs of elements of $V$ with no repeats. A particular vertex is often called\n",
    "$u$ or $v$ and each vertex has degree $d_u$. We disallow loops and multiple edges at the\n",
    "start, noting that multiple edges can be interpreted as edge weights in future developments. \n",
    "A graph may have multiple connected components. We'll generally take $n \\ge 2$ as assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot of additional preliminary terminology to set up.\n",

    "- A graph can be represented as either a Laplacian or a normalized Laplacian $n\\;\\times\\;n$ matrix\n",
    "- For an un-directed graph this will be real symmetric and will have real non-negative eigenvalues\n",
    "- These $n$ eigenvalues are sorted in increasing order $\\{\\lambda_0,\\;\\lambda_1,\\;\\lambda_2\\;\\dots\\;\\lambda_{n-1}\\}$\n",
    "    - ...using Chung's subscript notation beginning at 0\n",
    "- The number of 0 eigenvalues corresponds to the number of connected components.\n",

    "Define a cut as a (minimal) collection of cut edges to break the graph into disconnected sub-graphs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Important in getting to Cheeger's inequality: Rayleigh quotients of eigenvalues orthogonal to\n",
    "the $1$ vector corresponding to $\\lambda_0=0$. The RQ is used in an upper bound on IPR. The \n",
    "second eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ is used in like fashion to give an upper bound of the IPR of G. \n",
    "That is we want to find vertex subsets S with low isoperimetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something like $\\theta(S_t)\\le \\sqrt{2d\\lambda_1}$.\n",
