    "\n",
    "To use Turtle graphics begin a program like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from turtle import Turtle\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this program is to draw (with the turtle) an interesting pattern, following a recipe from\n",
    "the world of computer science. The recipe is a collection of ideas that we will turn into Python code. We will use\n",
    "a turtle; and some other Python items: Lists, functions, loops, and logic. I have broken this down into five parts.\n",
    "This is Part 1 and it should take no more than a few minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I will now give you a quick preview: That we will be drawing horizontal rows that contain both dots and spaces. \n",
    "The very first row will go from left to right across the top of the turtle's window. The turtle will draw the \n",
    "dots. The second row will be below the first, and so on down the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To get your gears turning: At this point please obtain a piece of paper and a pencil or pen. Draw a series of 16 \n",
    "open circles in a row. Now pick seven of these at random and fill those ones in. It is like a street with houses; \n",
    "some empty and some occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The row of circles represents sixteen \"living spaces\".  Becauase these are in a line, in a row, we say it is \n",
    "one-dimensional. The first row (the one you drew or the first one the program draws) represents the situation \n",
    "in the living spaces at the first moment of time. That is called time zero. We use a Python variable called time\n",
    "that will start out with a value of zero. `time = 0`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a time clock that will count upward from `time = 0`. The next time will be `time = 1` and then `time = 2`.\n",
    "You can imagine this will work well as a for-loop. As time goes on our living space may change. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As time moves along 0, 1, 2, 3, ... and the living space changes we could draw the latest picture of it over the \n",
    "previous version. However this will erase the visual information about the past. So, instead what do you imagine\n",
    "we will do? Excuse me while I take a sip of my soda while you consider... \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So the idea is this: Each new version of the living space (with time) is drawn below the previous one. In this way \n",
    "time goes downwards on the paper or on the screen. Here is an example using a simple rule. Draw 16 new circles below\n",
    "the first set. The rule is: If the cell is occupied it becomes empty. If it is empty it becomes occupied. You can\n",
    "fill in the second row (`time = 1`) using this rule. What happens when you apply the rule again for yet another \n",
    "time step (`time = 2`)? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As the rows accumulate from top to bottom we see time passing for the living space. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your next task is in the **repl.it** code. You have already begun with the line `from turtle import Turtle`. \n",
    "Now you should create a new turtle named `joe`. Set the `speed` of `joe` to be zero (that is 'fastest possible')\n",
    "and set the pen to be `up`. You can also set the `pencolor` if you like; but do not change the heading of `joe`.\n",
    "We want `joe` to always be facing to the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final task in **Part 1** is to write a function. It will include six lines of code and they are all\n",
    "given here. Type these lines of code beneath your other code.\n",
    "\n",

    "> There is an introduction to **functions** on page 81 of the book *Python for Kids*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python a function is a block of code with three parts: A *name*, some *arguments* and a *body*.\n",
    "It always begins with `def` for *define*. Then the function name is **DrawDots**. There are two\n",
    "arguments, `c` and `time`. The *body* of the function is the five lines of code indented below the\n",
    "`def` line. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The *name* of the function acts like a command. Who gives this command? *You* do by writing that *name* \n",
    "into other parts of your program. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to say this: \n",
    "The function is called by *name* by other lines of code, lower down in the program. \n",
    "When the function is called: The code in the *body* of the function\n",
    "runs. It does stuff. In our case this function will do what the name says: It will draw some dots. \n",
    "So what are the *arguments* `c` and `time`? We get to decide that later. (This is a bit like taking \n",
    "apart a car to figure out how it works.) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize: The `DrawDots()` function will be used later in the program as a little unit of code that \n",
    "does a particular task. Functions are commonly used to bundle up code in a sensible way. They can often\n",
    "be called by different parts of a program but in our case we just need to call this function once. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What do the lines of code in the function do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will come back to this later in more detail. Briefly: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1)  def DrawDots(c, time):\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first line of code gives the function a name\n",
    "and declares two variables `c` and `time` that come into play when the body of the function runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(2)      joe.goto(-200, 200 - 4 * time)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line of code moves the turtle to the beginning of a row. Which row? The row determined by what `time` it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(3)      for i in range(len(c)):\n",
    "```\n",
    "This line of code creates a loop across the row. It is important to realize that `c` will be a `list` and that\n",
    "`len(c)` is the *length* of that list. For this reason `range(len(c))` gives a for-loop that will scan that list `c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(4)          if c[i]: \n",
    "```\n",
    "This is an `if` statement that checks whether this element of the list `c` is `True`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(5)              joe.dot(2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If it *is* `True` then the turtle will draw a dot for that living space.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(6)          joe.forward(4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Whether or not the turtle draws a dot: It must now move forward 4 pixels to the next location in this row. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to test this function to make sure it works. Now that you have a sense I hope of what the function does: \n",
    "Hit Enter a couple of times in your code editor below the function and enter this test code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "livingspace = [True, False, True, True, False, False, True, False, False, False, True, True]\n",
    "mytime = 0\n",
    "DrawDots(livingspace, mytime)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this code you should see some dots that correspond to the True / False sequence you put in `livingspace`.\n",
    "Once you have this running see if you can create two more tests below the first one. You can look down below at my \n",
    "solution by scrolling down but I suggest you try it on your own first! \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# second test\n",
    "livingspace[1] = True\n",
    "livingspace[2] = False\n",
    "mytime = 1\n",
    "DrawDots(livingspace, mytime)\n",
    "\n",
    "# third test\n",
    "livingspace[2] = True\n",
    "livingspace[10] = False\n",
    "mytime = 2\n",
    "DrawDots(livingspace, mytime)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your code does what you expect and everything runs smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes Part 2; three more to go. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python *kernel* and how it runs the `DrawDots()` function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have something that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from turtle import Turtle\n",
    "\n",
    "joe = Turtle()\n",
    "joe.up()\n",
    "joe.pencolor(\"blue\")\n",
    "joe.speed(0)\n",
    "\n",
    "def DrawDots(c, time):\n",
    "    joe.goto(-200, 200 - time*4)\n",
    "    for i in range(len(c)):\n",
    "        if c[i]: \n",
    "            joe.dot(2)\n",
    "        joe.forward(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# test code\n",
    "livingspace = [True, False, True]\n",
    "mytime = 0\n",
    "DrawDots(livingspace, mytime)\n",
    "# ...and so on with test code, time = 1 and time = 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we have written the test code at the bottom, after the function DrawDots() is defined with `def`. \n",
    "This is necessary \n",
    "since Python runs from top to bottom. By putting `def DrawDots()` at the top the Python *kernel* knows that it\n",
    "exists. The kernel is like the conductor of running the program. When we call the `DrawDots()` function in line 21 \n",
    "Python's kernel knows what to do. As a narrative its thinking sounds like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Oh I must run the `DrawDots()` function. Ok: what does it expect? It expects something it will call `c` and\n",
    "> another thing it will call `time` (because the `def` line reads `def DrawDots(c, time)`. Very well; what do \n",
    "> I have in the call of the function down at the bottom? I have two arguments, and they are `livingspace` and\n",
    "> `mytime`. So I guess that `livingspace` is equivalent to `c` and `mytime` is equivalent to `time`. Ok I can do \n",
    "> that. Now that I know what `c` and `time` are: What else does `DrawDots()` need? Well it uses something called\n",
    "> `joe`. Ah, but I see `joe` is defined even higher up in the program as a `Turtle`. So everything is covered and\n",
    "> I can start running the `DrawDots()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a real program\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a picture of how the function works it is time to delete all of the test code and replace it \n",
    "with some real code that gets us closer to our goal: Watching the living space change over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and delete the test code and create a new version of livingspace. Let us make it 32 spaces across, \n",
    "all of them `False` except the middle space which will be `True`. Let us also decide that time will go forward\n",
    "from zero to 19, so there will be 20 ticks on our time clock. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code to type in: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "nSpaces = 32\n",
    "livingspace = [False] * nSpaces\n",
    "livingspace[nSpaces / 2] = True\n",
    "\n",
    "nTimeTicks = 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when we use `True` and `False` they are not in quotes. They are not text strings. They are a special\n",
    "kind of variable in Python called a boolean. A boolean variable can have just about any name, just like other \n",
    "variables. For example you could be ridiculous about it: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "fredscatsfriendwhoisagoat = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a perfectly fine variable name but it is not very helpful in this program. Notice it is a *boolean* with \n",
    "value `False`. You can use these in `if` statements. For example (using the above variable):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if fredscatsfriendwhoisagoat:\n",
    "    print('How about that cat!')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Today is Friday')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What will be printed when this code runs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok onward: Try running this next line of code to make sure `livingspace` is what you think it is, a list of booleans: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(livingspace)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can create a time loop. Type this in at the bottom of your program and check that it runs properly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for mytime in range(7):\n",
    "    print('mytime is', mytime)\n",
    "    DrawDots(livingspace, mytime)\n",
    "    oldlivingspace = livingspace[:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will hopefully draw three identical versions of `livingspace` as dots, stacked vertically. What does the fourth\n",
    "line of code do, the one that says `oldlivingspace = livingspace[:]`? It is mysterious... and it actually is not \n",
    "required yet; but it will be useful in what comes next. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That line of code does a copy of the list `livingspace` into a different list called `oldlivingspace`. We need such a copy\n",
    "because we are inside of a loop; and each time the clock ticks (the loop loops back around) we draw `livingspace`. In order\n",
    "for `livingspace` to not be the same every time we need to change it. It will change based on what it contains... but we \n",
    "are unable to change it in place. Instead we calculate the new version of `livingspace` from its copy, `oldlivingspace`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the above code working add these lines of code to see how we can change `livingspace`. *Be careful!* This \n",
    "code is indented one tab so that it is *inside* the `mytime` loop. The word `for` should line up with `oldlivingspace` \n",
    "in the previous line of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    for i in range(len(oldlivingspace)):\n",
    "        if oldlivingspace[i] or oldlivingspace[i-1]: \n",
    "            livingspace[i] = True\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            livingspace[i] = False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now before running this program: Take a good look at it and predict what you will see. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If it works you should see the rows changing each time. That's the end of Part 3; you are over half-way done! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 4\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to connect the `livingspace` list to a rule\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next section of this project we will create a more interesting rule for what happens to `livingspace` from \n",
    "one moment in time to the next. Let's call these moments *time ticks*, like ticks on a clock, and imagine that we have a version\n",
    "of the `livingspace` list at `time = 0` and we want to change this for one time tick later at `time = 1`. Then we will use\n",
    "`livingspace` at `time = 1` to determine what it becomes at `time = 2` and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall that after we use `DrawDots()` to draw the current `livingspace` we copy this list into another\n",
    "list called `oldlivingspace`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    oldlivingspace = livingspace[:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `oldlivingspace` as a reference to determine the new `livingspace` at the\n",
    "next time tick. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call each location in `livingspace` a *cell*. Each cell is either `True` or `False`. If it is `True` we imagine \n",
    "it is *occupied* and if it is `False` we imagine it is empty. Now for that more interesting rule for what happens to\n",
    "each cell in `livingspace`. Here we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our rule for cells:\n",
    "The cell at the next time tick depends upon three cells at this time tick: The cell plus its two neighbor cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three cells in `livingspace` at list locations 6, 7 and 8:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "       . . .    6      7      8    . . .\n",
    "              False  True   False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The new value of cell 7 (at the next time tick) is going to depend on cell 7 at this time tick; and also on cell 6 \n",
    "and also on cell 8 at this time tick. The new value of cell 8 will depend on cells 7, 8 and 9. The new value of \n",
    "cell 6 will depend on cells 5, 6, and 7. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a more extended picture. I use an `o` when a cell is `True` and a blank ` ` when it is `False`.\n",
    "Again the top row shows the index values for the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10\n",
    " [ ]  [ ]  [o]  [o]  [ ]  [ ]  [o]  [o]  [o]  [ ]  [o]   time = 0\n",
    " [o]  [o]  [o]  [o]  [o]  [o]  [o]  [ ]  [o]  [ ]  [ ]   time = 1\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here notice that `livingspace` contains 11 cells. We see this at two time ticks above. \n",
    "The `time = 1` version is calculated from the `time = 0` version. We use `oldlivingspace`\n",
    "for this. The `time = 1` cell value at location 4 depends on the cell values at locations \n",
    "3, 4 and 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us notice a problem. The calculation works fine for cell locations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. \n",
    "Why? Because all of those cells have neighbor cells on both sides of them. However it does not work \n",
    "for cell locations 0 and 10. Think about this for a moment: How should we handle cell locations 0 and 10? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to just ignore the missing locations. Since there is no cell location (-1) and no\n",
    "cell location (11) we just ignore them when we calculate cell (0) and cell (10). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take a different approach. We imagine that our living space wraps around like a bracelet so that cells\n",
    "(0) and (10) are next to one another. Now the left-neighbor of cell (0) is cell (10) and the right neighbor\n",
    "of cell (10) is cell (0). This is sometimes called wrap-around.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can use our rule for every cell in `livingspace`. There is some tricky Python code to handle this.\n",
    "As with the earlier parts of this project we will first see and then type in this tricky code; and then \n",
    "we will explain what it is doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Converting these ideas to code\n",
    "\n",
    "We have three pieces of code to add to our program now. Since this is the new rule: First delete the \n",
    "old rule inside the time loop. The time loop should now look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for mytime in range(nTimeTicks):\n",
    "    print('mytime is', mytime)\n",
    "    DrawDots(livingspace, mytime)\n",
    "    oldlivingspace = livingspace[:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice I have made one change from before, in that first line. It now uses `nTimeTicks` in `range()`\n",
    "rather than the number `6`. So make sure that change is in place. We set the value of `nTimeTicks`\n",
    "up a little bit higher in the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All three new pieces of code will live inside of this `mytime` loop so\n",
    "again be sure to put them below all the code so far and be sure the code is\n",
    "indented four spaces. Here is the first bit of code to add: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    rule = [False, True, False, True, True, False, True, False]\n",

    "    for i in range(nSpaces):\n",
    "        i1 = i - 1\n",

    "        livingspace[i] = rule[ruleIndex]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if everything is ok this should run (start drawing `livingspace` for several time ticks). \n",
    "This shows how our new rule works. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now the challenge -- for Part 5 -- is to understand what this code is doing. The check on \n",
    "understanding it is to change the rule and predict what the new rule will do. Notice that \n",
    "the rule is set up as a list with `rule = [False, True, False, True, True, False, True, False]`. \n",
    "At first look this might be rather mysterious. The other thing that is mysterious (at least\n",

    "\n",
    "The code for this program may seem mysterious or a bit complicated. This is why I broke the project down into five \n",
    "parts, to try and make it a more gradual hill to climb. My goal is to show you what is possible with just\n",
    "a few lines of code without staying in the area of super-basic. There are two good results of this approach; \n",
    "at least I hope. First this code is from real computer science. It is an open door into a world of ideas \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Second: My hope is that by seeing certain patterns in the Python code -- the way it is written -- you will\n",
    "begin to see the elegance of computer programming. If you listen to an unfamiliar language being spoken \n",

    "### What did that rule do? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that our rule was written as a list of boolean values `True` and `False`: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    rule = [False, True, False, True, True, False, True, False]\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "These have eight indices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. So `rule[6]` has value `True`and \n",
    "`rule[7]` has value `False`. \n",
    "If we say `print(rule[2])` we should see **True**. So now here is the key idea: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***The eight rule values provide us all possible new values for a cell in `livingspace`.***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok what does this mean? Why *eight* values and not nine? What does *possible* mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's work from an example. We will focus on cell number 7: What happens there at the next\n",
    "time tick? Cell number 7 is going to have a new value based on what is found\n",
    "in cell 6, in cell 7 and in cell 8. That is, in cell 7 and in its two neighbors. Let's describe every \n",
    "possibility for these cells, supposing we do not know what they actually are. \n",
    "I use `o` for a cell that is occupied and `-` for a cell that is empty. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cell location  6   7   8\n",
    "               -   -   -        all three cells are empty\n",
    "               -   -   o        cell 8 is occupied, 6 and 7 are empty\n",
    "               -   o   -        only cell 7 is occupied\n",
    "               -   o   o        ...and...\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us examine the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 if they are written in base-2 (binary) notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "decimal            binary (requires three digits: 4s, 2s and 1s)\n",

    "   7                111\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compare these two listings -- the possiblities for cells 6, 7 and 8 and the \n",
    "binary values -- we notice they match up\n",
    "perfectly. This means that we can use cells 6, 7 and 8\n",
    "as a three-digit binary number. That is: There are 8 possibilities for cells \n",
    "6, 7 and 8. One of these is all empty: 0 0 0. One is all occupied: 1 1 1. And \n",
    "there are six more for a total of eight. If we turn this into a decimal number\n",
    "it will have one of these values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. This number can \n",
    "be used as an *index* of the `rule` list. If our neighbrs are 1 1 0 (occupied / \n",
    "occupied / empty) in cells 6, 7 and 8 that gives us 4 + 2 + 0 = 6. `rule[6]` \n",
    "has a value of `True` so that will be `livingspace[7]` in the next time tick. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To say this another way: When we convert three cells from binary to decimal it \n",
    "becomes our rule index. Let's work a couple more examples to see \n",
    "how this works. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that cell 6 in `livingspace` is `True`. That is `livingspace[6] = True`. Suppose cell\n",
    "7 is `False` and cell 8 is `True`. What should cell 7 be at the next time tick? These\n",
    "cells 6, 7 and 8 are interpreted as binary digits in the 4s, 2s and 1s places. `True` is 1\n",
    "and `False` is 0. So in this case `True False True` becomes\n",
    "`1 0 1` in binary which is `4 + 1 = 5` in decimal. `rule[5]` is `False` so on the next time\n",
    "tick cell 7 will be `False` or *empty*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example: Suppose cell 6 is `False`, cell 7 is `False` and cell 8 is `True`. Now\n",
    "our binary digits are `0 0 1`. Cell 6 is the 4s digit, \n",
    "cell 7 is the 2s digit, cell 8 is the 1s digit. Our binary number 001 becomes `1` in decimal.\n",
    "Looking it up we see that `rule[1] = True` so in this case cell 7 will be occupied (`True`) on \n",
    "the next time tick. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not want to confuse the `livingspace` cells (which are `True` or `False`) \n",
    "with `rule` list values (which are *also* `True` or `False`). Both of them \n",
    "are lists but they play two different roles in our story here. Here is how they relate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* At each time tick we loop over all the cells\n",
    "* For each cell we look at its value and the value of its neighbors\n",
    "* This gives us a number between 0 and 7 inclusive, like say '4'\n",
    "* We use that '4' as an index to pick one element of the `rule` list\n",
    "  * `rule[4]` which happens to be `True`\n",
    "* This value `True` is copied from `rule` into `livingspace`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So the `rule` list is a *source* of `True` and `False` values that are copied into `livingspace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully it is clear now how all possible sequences of three cells connect to the `rule` list. \n",
    "No matter how they are arranged as a sequence of three `True/False` values: There will be a rule\n",
    "entry for what we put in the middle cell of the three at the next time tick. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So very good for cell 7; which refers also to cells 6 and 8. What about cell 8? Well for cell\n",
    "8 we need to check cells 7, 8 and 9. For cell 9 we use cells 8, 9 and 10. So this is why we \n",
    "have a for-loop that goes across all the cells in `livingspace`. And notice that it does the \n",
    "calculation not using `livingspace` but rather it uses `oldlivingspace`. This is why we made\n",
    "the copy of `livingspace`: If we calculated from `livingspace` and wrote the answer *back into* \n",
    "`livingspace` then we would mess up the calculation. It would be like adding two large numbers and\n",
    "changing the digits of one of them before you were finished: You would get the wrong answer. \n",
    "To avoid that we work from the copy, called `oldlivingspace`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary so far\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So -- deep breath -- we have set up two for-loops, one inside the other. The first or outer\n",
    "for-loop counts time, one time tick to the next. Within that for-loop is a second or inner\n",
    "for-loop that scrolls across all the cells in the `livingspace` list of cells. For each of \n",
    "these cells it calculates the new value by using three adjacent cells to generate a key, \n",
    "called the `ruleIndex`. It then looks up the results and writes that into the `livingspace`\n",
    "list before calling the `DrawDots()` function to show us the next time tick results. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now are we done? Not quite. There are a couple of things to tidy up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing `livingspace`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For `i = 0` at the first cell (cell 0) of `livingspace` we have an index `i - 1` for\n",
    "its neighbor to the left, which is `-1`. But allowed indices (we thought) run from\n",
    "0, 1, 2, ..., nSpaces - 1. Notice `-1` is not an option as far as we know. Furthermore\n",
    "that neighbor to the left is actually the one at the very far right end with index\n",
    "`nSpaces - 1` (because `livingspace` wraps around like a bracelet or a ring). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so what do we do about this? The good news is: We don't need to do anything special\n",
    "because Python already takes care of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python you can use an index of -1 to mean *the very last element of the list*. \n",
    "In other words Python has a built-in wrap-around for lists. That is why it is ok to use \n",
    "`livingspace[-1]` or `oldlivingspace[-1]`. This\n",
    "is interpreted as `livingspace[nSpaces - 1]` which is just the last element of the list.\n",
    "It is just what we want. This leaves us just one more problem which is what happens \n",
    "with the neighbor to the *right* at the very far right side of the `livingspace` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the cell to the *right* of cell `i` we have the index `i + 1` we can run into trouble \n",
    "at the very end of the loop. If the biggest value of `i` is `nSpaces - 1` then we would\n",
    "have index `nSpaces` which does not exist. There is not a wrap-around trick in Python like \n",
    "there was above. Instead we fix the index by using `(i + 1) % nSpaces`. This uses the \n",
    "**remainder** or **modulo** function to change that index to `0` which is what we want. \n",
    "You can look this up in your *Python for Kids* book if you like: The modulo operator `%`. \n",
    "It keeps us out of trouble at the far right edge of 'livingspace'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it as far as understanding the code. Let me know if you have questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next-to-last item\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `rule` list has eight elements, each one either `True` or `False`. The rule\n",
    "that I chose is called Rule 90. (See if you can figure out why.) You can change this rule\n",
    "to be any sequence of eight `True` or `False` values that you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a first challenge for you: Try a few alternative rules to see if you can produce \n",
    "some other interesting patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a second challenge for you: Come up with an idea for a rule and see if you can \n",
    "convert that into a `rule` list that does precisely what you expect. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Last item\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall that we started off this year with a project that filled in the Pascal triangle. \n",
    "There is a simpler version of the Pascal triangle where you only worry about even/odd. The `1` at the \n",
    "very top is odd so you draw that as a dot. Maybe an even number is just a blank space. So...\n",
    "you can imagine everywhere else in the top row is zeros \n",
    "which are even. You know that odd + even = odd, even + odd = odd, odd + odd = even, and even + even = even. \n",
    "This is a rule; just like in our program; so now you can write out this new version of the triangle \n",
