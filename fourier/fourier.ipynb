    "$N$-element real-valued *vector* $\\tilde{x}$. For some mysterious reason we wish \n",
    "to express this information in terms of a *transform* vector $\\tilde{X}$, also of size $N$. \n",
    "(By the way $\\tilde{x}$ could be complex-valued but let's make it\n",
    "real-valued.) To distinguish the signal vector $\\tilde{x}$ from the transform vector\n",
    "$\\tilde{X}$ on an element-wise basis let's use a convention that the $\\tilde{X}$ subscript \n",
    "will be $k$ and the $\\tilde{x}$ subscript will be $n$. Also we number elements starting\n",
    "at element zero: The first element of $\\tilde{x}$ is $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An example signal: $\\tilde{x} = \\{ 0.2, 3.9, -1.1, -12.0, 0.1, 0.0, -4.4 \\}$ which has $N = 7$ values. $x_2 = -1.1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the definition of the *forward* discrete Fourier transform:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{align}\n",
    "X_k = \\sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} x_n \\cdot e^{-i\\frac{2 \\pi}{N} \\cdot n \\cdot k}\n",
    "\\end{align}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $N$ such values of $X_k$; each a complex number. In English we say\n",
    "\"The $k^{th}$ element of the Fourier transform of $\\tilde{x}$ is a sum over\n",
    "all the elements of $\\tilde{x}$ each multiplied by a number on the complex\n",
    "unit circle.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "This is another *convention* that ensures the *inverse* transform\n",

    "We can also adopt a symmetrical convention: Both transforms have a leading\n",
    "coefficient of $\\sqrt{1/N}$. This also gets us \"back to where we started\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I can't resist pointing out another connection to linear algebra: When we\n",
    "have a linear transform -- say a matrix $A$ --  and we seek its inverse: \n",
    "We must include in the inverse a leading coefficient $\\frac{1}{det \\; A}$. \n",
