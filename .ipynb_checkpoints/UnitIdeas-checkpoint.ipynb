    "## A Compound Language Serpinski Gasket\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Serpinski gasket pattern (a complex of subdivided triangles) appears in multiple contexts. \n",
    "It can be constructed with lines; or with triangular regions. (And in three dimensions: With planes or \n",
    "with volumes.) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be constructed from points: See the paint / dice scheme in the Chaos Game notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is found within the Pascale triangle as the distribution of even and odd numbers. In what \n",
    "amounts to the same idea it can be generated using one-dimensional cellular automata. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be reconstructed by unfurling jointed line segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit the Serpinski Gasket appears from the evolution of what I call a \n",
    "'Compound Language'. Begin with two atomic words 'x' and 'y' that are the smallest legal sentences.\n",
    "The idea is to define a means of building more complicated sentences; and then to pivot from\n",
    "*writing* sentences to *picturing* sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other legal sentences are constructed from 'x' and 'y' by inserting extra characters '+' and '-'\n",
    "between occurrences of 'x' and 'y'. These connector characters can be thought of as \n",
    "*different from* 'x' and 'y'; and they become important in the *picture* version of the language. \n",
    "So that is the very simple *compound* language with { 'x', 'y' } and { '+', '-' } being the\n",
    "compound parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how to build longer sentences? Easy peasy: We can simply write out a sequence of 'x' and 'y'\n",
    "words separated by '+' and '-' words in any way we like. However for our purposes here let us\n",
    "create *substitution* rules that will prove to be fun. For any sentence we go through and make\n",
    "the following substitutions, being careful to preserve any '+' or '-' words in the new sentence\n",
    "by simply copying them over. Let's refer to this as **Rule S**. \n",

    "- 'x' -> 'y + x + y'\n",
    "- 'y' -> 'x - y - x'\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this substitution once from sentence 'x' gives 'y + x + y'. Doing it a second time (*iteration*)\n",
    "gives 'x - y - x + y + x + y + x - y - x'. What do we get with five iterations? Clearly the final\n",
    "sentence is starting to get pretty long. Once we have applied the rule through several iterations\n",
    "we can pivot to drawing a picture of the result. So now we had better go about defining \"How to draw\n",
    "the picture\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a drawing creature (ok: In Python it is a **turtle** if you like) pointed along some heading on \n",
    "a flat piece of paper (or a computer screen). A legal sentence in our language contains a sequence of \n",
    "'+' and '-' symbols interspersed with 'x' and 'y' symbols. For now we will ignore the latter and only\n",
    "attend to the sequence of '+'s and '-'s. To visualize a sentence we begin at the beginning, go through\n",
    "the entire sentence from left to right ignoring 'x' and 'y' words. Let's call the turtle drawing \n",

    "In this way the sentence 'y + x + y' will produce a simple drawing of two line segments. \n",

    "Now at last we have a recipe for creating a particular drawing:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- start with the sentence 'x'\n",
    "- Expand this sentence five times by iteratively applying **Rule S**\n",
    "- Draw the resulting sentence using **Rule D**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that Rule S and Rule D operate on different aspects of our compound language. The\n",
    "letters are used to expand sentences and the '+' / '-' characters are used to draw the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the basic exercise is done: We might imagine how to change the parameters to explore alternative\n",
    "ideas. The easiest to change is the number of iterations of Rule S. We can also change 'forward 10 steps'\n",
