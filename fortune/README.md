### Overview

The **fortune** project is an extension of the magic eight ball. You are trying to give the person
running the program the impression that you (the computer) are all-knowing and all-seeing. You can
make this into a fortune-teller based on the person's birthday; or you could ask them some other
questions like 'what is your favorite color?' Once you have some information you can 
have the program print some advice or predict the future. 

Since this program works with input and output it is a good warm-up to writing a text adventure game.
