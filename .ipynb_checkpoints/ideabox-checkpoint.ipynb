They build context webs under their own power and they can sail through books by Martin Gardner having the time of their life.

    "I would like to provide a practical anecdote from my own experience. This has happened to me many many times: I read through a book on mathematics, I find a particular problem, and I set to work. The problem involves perhaps a myriad of possible solutions and I begin following up a particular idea. This turns into some algebra and suddenly I am expanding infinite sums of polynomials simply writing out line after line of symbols like an automaton; only to run aground on the shores of the Mare Insolvus. (need the proper Latin here; ask David Beck) (this sea goes on the map) Then I sit back and realize that the original author posed the problem precisely because there is an Aha solution… so I finally allow myself to relax and think about that. And within a few minutes the solution appears. This happened for the Gardner problem concerning the worm going through the 3 x 3 x 3 cube. I could tell the problem could be represented as a path through a graph but I became caught up in drawing the \n",
    "graph which prevented me from noticing the key idea that the worm alternates between edges and (faces or corners). \n",

    "page and they miss the opportunity to speed up the process by sitting back for a look at the bigger picture. \n",

    "What we do not want is to only solve Aha problems. We want to solve extended problems--what I call hikes--with extended diligence of effort.  The nature of the hike, ideally, is to cover some different types of terrain and to arrive somewhere familiar at the end; 'back at the car'. \n",

    "There is a sports metaphor at work here as well, one that raises a difficult problem for the author. A basketball team plays a game and loses; and the team members reflect. Was the loss due to experiences in previous games, one game per week? Perhaps. But more important might be what happened in practice two nights per week over the season. But no: What really mattered was what did or did not happen every single day. Did the players go outside in their backyard or on the sidewalk and practice dribbling the ball? Shooting against the side of a building? Passing back and forth for hours with a friend? Sprinting down to the corner of the block, resting for ten seconds, and doing it again… and again… and again… until that became easier… and then going two blocks. In short: Repetitions help solidify our skills. The road through the mathematics landscape that is the school curriculum is full of repetitions. There is no substitute for 99.99% of us for doing hundreds or thousands of algebra problems. If you write down x you should automatically know you could also write that as $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x}}$.  \n",

But after setting out she gets as far as 1/2 and decides to go no further. Looking back she decides to return to Zero but again only makes it halfway, stopping at 1/4. She turns around again and decides to go back to 1/2. But you guessed it: She only makes it half way and stops at 3/8. By continuously reversing direction and proceeding in this manner she eventually arrives at a particular location on the real number line. Where does she end up? What does it mean to 'arrive at a specific location' by making an infinite number of progressively shorter journeys? \n",

    "fireplace, and she had some kittens to play with. In short she had it made. But there was a large mirror\n",
