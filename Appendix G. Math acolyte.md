## Introduction

The purpose of this page is to introduce an inverted pyramid of mathematical process as a form of identity. The underlying normative premise is that mathematics as a language leads to a form of thinking that is in some normative sense _good for us_. Specifically it enables us to argue from reason and understand choices as meaningful, distinct alternative paths that will impact our future well-being.

## There is a hypothesis...

...in social science that language determines thought. It may be a little circular since habits and customs are arguably tied
to language and these may in turn reflect necessities in thought patterns. 

Be that as it may let's take the idea a step past language to mathematics. We can admire the precision of mathematics
and thereby say 'the more i speak in terms of math the more precise my thinking'. This is a normative statement so it
might be best to begin with a few axioms and observations.

* Mathematics is taken to be the exploration and discovery of patterns through imagination and reason.

  * Observing: Western mathematics draws historically from the theory of numbers and could be seen as one possible landscape of many to follow the pattern definition. 
  
* Problems exist where our thinking / our language is insufficiently expressive or comprehensive. 

  * In this sense mathematics as language uses problems to advance rapidly in comparison to traditional human language. 
  
* Speaking in a normative sense ('what is desirable') we can take on the task of promoting mathematics as a structured willful act that creates opportunity and freedom for other people...

  * ...and that is a good and a desirable thing.
  
* Therefore consider a progression as acolyte from A to B to ... to N as a path: Growing as a mathematician enables one to better serve others.

  * ...and this again is a desirable thing.
  
## The progression

Solving problems that involve calculation might be **A**, the first step in the progression of an acolyte mathematician. 

Understanding and using abstract reasoning to establish proofs might be **B**. 

Seeing connections ('lemmas') between disparate subjects might be **F**.

Composing problems goes where? **G**? Perhaps this is where the exploration of patterns comes in: We go through several stages to reach a point where we actually touch the definition of mathematics.

Teaching others goes where? Let's suppose **N**.

As we go further in the chain from **A** to **B** to **C** to ... we suppose that the number of acolytes drops (since the way to **C** is only through **B**). Therefore at **N** we begin to teach but there are fewer of us. I imagine we have two reasons: First like the feet at the bottom of chair legs we are there to support everyone else. We are at the bottom of an inverted pyramid. Second we can balance exploring and teaching.

Finally if I am an inverted pyramid, a mathematician who teaches, why can't I be this person five minutes after I learn the meaning of addition? Certainly I can; there is no priesthood and no minimum initiation time. If we represent an inverted triangle then it is a Serpinski gasket that is barely held together by the minimal amount we know, a structure built of holes.

## Borrowing from English

The use of a religious term _acolyte_ is intentional here. Mathematics makes use of agreed conventions that are not defined, for example the idea of a point. In light of incompleteness and other limitations of logic and language I am intentionally blurring the distinction
between an undefinable basis for a school of thought (mathematics) and a set of beliefs that form the basis for a deist world view. Drawing such a distinction -- in my view -- obscures a much simpler and more practical distinction between science and religion: Science simply changes much faster than does religion for two reasons: First science is much more detailed and second science is amenable to progress through reason, observation and experiment.
