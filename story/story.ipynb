    "The time had come for Kid Pipkin's birthday party; and seeing as how she was turning 18\n",
    "it was a momentous event; a Long Expected Party of great important for one does not turn\n",
    "18 every day you know; \n",
    "and so everyone had taken extra special care to travel to the port town, \n",
    "taken special care to arrive on time. Some were familiar names and others\n",
    "she had not heard from in quite awhile. Of course the celebration was at Fyz Byzkyn's \n",
    "farmhouse; and Kid Pipkin showed up well in advance to help with preparations. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Oh I'm so glad you came early' said Fyz Byzkyn. 'The horses have not been watered yet and today\n",
    "they happen to need precisely seven gallons.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Kid Pipkin arrived at the watering trough but found only a nine and a five gallon container. ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back into the house she remarked 'Your horses seemed in very good spirits, Kitty particularly.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Yes' said Fyz Byzkyn, 'I got them some hay fresh in from the fields... and I think they \n",
    "have worked out how to nibble blackberries at the fence now those have come in. July has just \n",
    "flown by.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a knock at the door, and Kid Pipkin went to welcome... who would it be? In fact it proved to\n",
    "be Alebasi, recently escaped and on the loose yet again, sporting a lovely pair of diamond earings, \n",
    "and up further along the drive walked Abcdef Ghijklmno Pqrstuvwxyz and Zyxwvutsr Qponmlkji Hgfedcba, \n",
    "hand in hand, who had stepped away from their easels at the beach to celebrate the occasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon they were joined by George Dyson, and together Curious George and the Man with the Yellow Hat.\n",
    "The Man With The Yellow hat does not speak in this story, for as was his custom he was present\n",
    "to protect Curious George from harm, and Curious George will not be at any risk except\n",
    "perhaps the risk of a sugar overdose. But the Man with the Yellow Hat does smile a great deal and he enjoys\n",
    "being a part of everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not far behind them came Horst Borskin deep in conversation with George Dyson. Surveying the \n",
    "gathered throng, Kid Pipkin found herself moved by how familiar and how beloved they all were. \n",
    "While years had passed it seemed to have not had the slightest effect: Everyone \n",
    "was chatting and laughing as if they were picking up from conversations from this morning or \n",
    "just the day before. \n",
    "\n",
    "The doorbell rang again and this time it was the girl with the skirt of many different colors, \n",
    "the skirt in variegated shades of orange, and finally\n",
    "behind her Put Bunkin (whose real name was Bisaella, and whose *real* real name was Isabella) \n",
    "carrying a large box. She was still Mayor at this time and we do not find out what is in the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon they sat down to supper (it was early afternoon), \n",
    "prepared by Fyz Byzkyn in a flurry of smoke and odors both mysterious\n",
    "and slightly burnt floating out from the kitchen. The order of events was peculiar\n",
    "to put it mildly: First Fyz Byzkyn brought out a birthday cake with 18 lit candles, and according to \n",
    "custom they all sang Happy Birthday (though Zyxwvutsr sang it backwards) before Kid Pipkin made a wish\n",
    "and blew them out. The cake proved to be an Inverse Cake with three \n",
    "very thick layers made of frosting separated by thin slivers of cake, and with more cake \n",
    "formed in a cylinder about the perimeter and a disc of cake covering the top. Fyz Byzkyn seemed so pleased with \n",
    "his invention that nobody bothered to mention that a cake made mostly of frosting was a bit on the \n",
    "rich side. And Curious George didn't mind anyway. \n",
    "After cake was finished it was time for the main course (crab-stuffed mushrooms with brussels sprouts), \n",
    "and then a salad and at last a series of appetizers which all seemed to involve pesto.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is much like the Backwards Dinners we used to get in the dreadful Army\" observed Horst Borskyn \n",
    "shaking his head.\n",
    "As usual nobody had any idea what Horst Borskyn was talking about so they merely nodded and\n",
    "looked thoughtful. But suddenly, when a minute had gone by after this remark, \n",
    "a gleam of triumph appeared in Fyz Byzkyn's eye.\n",
    "\"Oh ho\" he began, enjoying the moment beyond measure, \"this meal is not *like* a Backwards Dinner Horst Borskyn,\n",
    "it ***is***\" (and here he drew out the word 'is' for about ten seconds) \"...a Backwards Dinner. And now I\n",
    "should like to ask, How did you enjoy the Backwards Dinner, Kid Pipkin??\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Overcome, Kid Pipkin tried for a suitably eloquent answer... but what came out was \n",
    "\"Well of course it was ever so much the most splendid birthday supper I've ever had, and the best you \n",
    "have ever cooked!'\" a grand \n",
    "smile spreading across her face. Then just as suddenly her countenance fell.  Everyone grew quiet \n",
    "and she continued in a small voice 'I only wish we could begin with this dinner and keep going backwards in time\n",
    "just, ever so quickly, to the days when\n",
    "I met you all, so many years ago, so that we might go out upon our adventures all over again.'\n",
    "And her eyes began shedding great tears. Nobody spoke but they all stood up and gathered about her and \n",
    "arms reached out to create a group hug the biggest any of them could remember, \n",
    "and there was a great deal of sniffling and \n",
    "wiping of faces and noses. "

    "(and there was some polite chuckling) '...but perhaps we can tell stories, and remind ourselves of \n",
    "some of those adventures. So I will go first...' and she began by recalling the vast chasm\n",
    "within the high vaulted peaks of the Sierra Nevada mountains, but she reminded them that she \n",
    "had been unable to go on this particular expedition at the start owing to her job as Mayor.\n",

    "wizards in question looked down at the floor in slight embarrassment. They had been the quietest \n",
    "guests and were feeling a little self-conscious, having been the villains of the earliest adventur,\n",
    "at a certain moment long ago.\n",
    "You may not remember though of course you know their names, but it began with some shenanigans \n",
    "involving a T.Rex.\n",
    "'Yes' said George Dyson, and sensing the wizards' discomfort he added '...and I do wish that all of\n",
    "our stories could end as that one did, making new friends that once were enemies.' \n",
    "\n",
    "There was a pause as everyone had a little think, and then the girl with the multicolored skirt\n",
    "(who had also been fairly quiet to this point) spoke up. 'I seem to recall there was a time \n",
    "when we had to negotiate with a terrible sea monster who was grabbing passing ships... but \n",
    "the memory is so distant now... I remember it had built a castle of stone on the sea floor...' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Oh indeed' said George Dyson 'and that was when we discovered that you \n",
    "lived with and spoke with and even rode about\n",
    "on whales in your spare time. I always found it curious that you didn't really mention this earlier.'\n",
    "\n",
    "'Megaptera Novaeangliae as I recall' said Put Bunkin.\n",

    "'Well, one doesn't like to make a fuss' replied the girl. Strange that we have never learned\n",
    "her name don't you think? 'And besides,' she continued, 'don't we all of us have rather\n",
    "unusual native habitats? I mean, just consider for example that George lives in a miraculous treehouse\n",
    "high in a Douglas fir; and Alebasi's usual domicile is...' her voice trailed\n",
    "off as she considered whether it was polite to continue.\n",

    "'...in *prison*' Alebasi finished for her, with a big smile. 'That's true and I count myself\n",

    "my arrest and incarceration at least three times, which I do respect. As I was breaking out of\n",
    "prison yesterday (to attend this party) I found myself wishing it was a little more difficult\n",
    "these days. With all the practice it has just become routine, about as difficult as shopping\n",
    "for groceries. Plus now come to think of it: I'm out again! So I will need\n",
    "to find some lodging and start paying rent... so... Fyz Byzkyn you wouldn't happen to \n",

    "'Yes' said Fyz Byzkyn (though it sounded more like 'Yus') 'You can stay in the guest room for \n",
    "as long as you like; and if anyone else would like to sleep over you are all of you more than welcome.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The room lapsed into general chit chat for some time until Put spoke up again (she seemed to have\n",

    "to work. Specifically I will have\n",
    "to sail to the moon. And the way to do that is: You know how a full moon sets on the ocean and sometimes \n",
    "there is a kind of a \n",
    "mirage where the bottom of the moon's circumference flips over and the effect is a kind of \n",
    "an Omega shape?' (Those who knew what an omega looks like now pictured this.) \n",
    "So one day I was thinking about this but not in terms of\n",
    "planets moving about and orbital mechanics and atmospheric lensing, \n",
    "but instead I found myself thinking in an abstract way about calculus on manifolds, \n",
    "and I proved to myself (I *think*) that for a couple of moments in the course of the moon setting I could \n",
    "navigate across the mirage in my sailboat,\n",
    "but only if I made a branch cut across time... and this would bring me to the moon but not\n",
    "today; and if I go about the branch cut counterclockwise I get to Yesterday\n",

    "clockwise which takes me to Tomorrow.\n",

    "and exclaimed 'Enough already! No more sad! Consider won't you, first there is more to the world than you know,\n",
    "more than anyone can ever know, and you are simply stepping forward, further in, further on. And what is more,\n",
    "we are, in this room, none of us, real. We are ideas, we are archetypes, emotions, emblems, symbols; \n",
    "and you have but to think of\n",
    "us and we are with you, for the rest of your life. We are not real in the sense you imagine of what is 'real',\n",

    "safety, a plan to get out of trouble when things go wrong in your adventures. That is me; I am you\n",
    "taking care of you, and so I *am* you. Now give me a hug!' After\n",
    "a hesitation Kid Pipkin took a step forward and wrapped her arms about Put Bunkin for \n",
    "what she intended to be a forever hug, \n",
    "and to her surprise after Put Bunkin\n",
    "had hugged her back she felt Put Bunkin change and compress and... fold?... there was no better term\n",
    "for it; and fold again and again until Put had folded down into a small paper card, perhaps the size \n",
    "of a birthday card. On this card was a \n",
    "beautiful abstract painting, and the painting *was* Put Bunkin. Kid Pipkin placed the card in her \n",
    "shirt pocket, above her heart, where she could feel it alive and glowing. And one by one each of \n",
