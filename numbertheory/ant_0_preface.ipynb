    "formation. 'Here is your problem: Climb\n",
    "to the top' the instructor said, pointing to a vertical cliff face.\n",
    "Whereupon (the instructor departing) \n",
    "the student examined the indicated cliff face, finding it to be vertical, smooth \n",
    "and featureless, with not so much as a tiny handhold. \n",
    "The student sat upon the ground, staring at the cliff. \n",
    "A year later he returned to his instructor.\n",
    "'I have not solved the problem yet' he reported, despondent.\n",
    "His instructor replied, 'Oh I assumed you had died.'\n",

    "\n",
    "Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little \n",

    "In due course I arrived at Caltech where I had the privilege of attending \n",
    "Professor Apostol's lectures as part of my Freshman curriculum. \n",

    "all business as he begins a lecture on a version\n",
    "of calculus more rigorous than what I had seen in highschool. \n",
    "At some point he would suddenly make an impossible, \n",
    "outrageous mathematical claim. There would follow a pause\n",
    "while he let this claim sink in... one might scoff quietly... \n",
    "and then Professor Apostol would continue by making the portentous \n",
    "remark, \"Now nobody can stop me from *making this claim*...\".\n",
    "Then there would be another pause... do you see it?... and then\n",
    "a logical argument would follow step by step, at the end of \n",
    "which this ridiculous claim was shown to be quite reasonably true. \n",
    "As Freshmen we did not always appreciate the fun of this style\n",
    "of narrative. \n",
    "\n",

    "Now in retrospect I \n",
