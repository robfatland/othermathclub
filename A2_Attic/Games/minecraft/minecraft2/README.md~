# PythonBytes Project In-Depth


[Link to here](https://github.com/robfatland/pythonbytes/tree/master/projects/minecraft#pythonbytes-project-in-depth)


### Overview


A certain billionaire has trapped you, Stargirl, on a Tesla Roadster headed towards Jupiter. If you are very careful
you can use your last few ounces of rocket fuel to fine-tune your arrival. Use your computer (and some Python) to
predict the proper entry path that will put you on a gravity-assist slingshot escape trajectory back towards the 
earth.

This project is not for the faint of heart; I would say it is advanced. One way to approach the programming
challenge is outlined below. As always it may help to consult with us, your Python Bytes coaches and teachers. 


### Details


The sketch of ideas goes like this...

- Work in only two dimensions 
- Establish the location, mass and radius of Jupiter
- Establish the locations, masses and radii of Io, Europa, Callisto and Ganymede
- Establish a series of starting locations with velocities (possible entry points of your spaceship)
- Use simple physics of gravity to travel forward in time
