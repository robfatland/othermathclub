    "Let's pursue trolls a bit more. We are fairly sure that we could walk\n",
    "the length of this earth and never come upon an actual living troll. But we will\n",
    "definitely find paintings of them, stories about them, even statues and\n",
    "sculptures of trolls. The idea of trolls is a real thing; or else I\n",
    "could not write this sentence. Trolls we can argue and discuss late into the night.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about a twenty-seven-dimensional box? The paper or screen holding\n",
    "these words lies flat, has two dimensions. The bus I ride has three physical dimensions.\n",
    "I know the number after three is four so what in my experience has four dimensions? \n",
    "Nothing! I do not have any experience of four dimensions. But I do know that \n",
    "shadows have one less dimension than the thing casting the shadow... so what\n",
    "does a three dimensional shadow of a four-dimensional object look like?\n",
    "And what about five or six or more dimensions? Let's suppose that, like for trolls,\n",
    "the idea is valid... but does it lead to anything substantial?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is really a comment on the premise of this book. The story of the \n",
    "Fishing Kid is presented in a manner that could actually happen. It uses\n",
    "a little finesse, that the silly bus driver's rule does not concern \n",
    "'longest dimension' but rather 'implicit dimension' of an object. But\n",
    "it is essentially a possible scenario. In contrast, the coda at the end \n",
    "of the story takes further liberties into boxes\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Presenting a new thing that\n",

    "back towards the familiar and the definite. \n",
    "In a sense the *uncertain* and the *familiar* are opposites. So what\n",
    "is meant by *familiar uncertainty*? This term -- which I just made up -- \n",

    "Research is the business of mostly not knowing, of mostly living \n",
    "in uncertainty and doubt, of living with a bewildering lack of \n",
    "comprehension. Hence for a person engaged in research, *uncertainty*\n",
    "becomes *familiar*. Sometimes the process brings us a great \n",
    "discovery. When this happens the satisfaction of answering a\n",
    "deep question can motivate us to press forward. But in many\n",

    "do not check their watches and trolls do not turn to stone in the morning sunshine. \n",
    "This book, on the other hand, is not like that. Everything in this book is real, \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we read about an extraordinary world we are presented with certain facts that are \n",
    "simply so. The author says: 'There are trolls here.' There it is. The agreed-upon rule is: \n",
    "They say there are trolls so we accept that as fact and keep reading.\n",
    "In *this* book the difference is: Because the extraordinary claims to be real, \n",
    "you have the option to decide if you agree. You choose. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have read this far: You are a good candidate for reading more of this book.\n",

    "What does it mean to think slowly? A chap named Daniel Kahneman\n",

    "He says that the new information starts out by making no sense to us. We could imagine it is\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "She gathered up some string and made a hook from a \n",
    "paper clip and grabbed a bag of cheese puffs to use as bait. She put five dollars\n",
    "in her pocket from her savings and she walked to the nearby bus stop to wait for\n",
    "the bus. When it arrived she paid her bus fare (one dollar) and rode the bus\n",
    "for 45 minutes to a bridge across a river. The bus driver did not seem to be \n",
    "paying her any attention... but he looked rather surprised at the pipe \n",
    "when she left the bus. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As she walked towards the bridge she passed a post office. A sign out front \n",
    "advertised cubical moving boxes, so many feet on a side. A small one foot cubical \n",
    "moving box cost $1, a two foot box cost $2, and so on up to five feet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "She continued on and made her way down to the banks of the river that flowed under\n",
    "the bridge. (It was called the D'enigmes River.)  She began fishing, a cheese puff\n",
    "skewered on the paper clip hook, attached to the metal pole by the string. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might guess, not a lot happened. Time passed. Minutes stretched to hours and\n",
    "never a bite from a fish, not even a nibble... and the cheese puffs would become\n",
    "soggy and fall off the hook and drift away. She decided to give up; and she \n",
    "returned to the bus stop near the river slightly disappointed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The bus pulled up but this time the driver was paying attention. As the girl began\n",
    "to board the bus driver said, 'No no no, I'm sorry but you may not bring anything\n",
    "on the bus longer than three feet. That metal pole is certainly five feet long.' \n",
    "\n",
