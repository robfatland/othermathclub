    "the best thing in the world was a window into a kind of\n",
    "mathematics that could not be found in textbooks.\n",
    "This window was delivered in monthly installments,\n",
    "courtesy of a mysterious, venerable figure named Martin Gardner. \n",

    "nothing less than a miracle. It was not merely a static\n",
    "window, you understand.\n",

    "*open and climb through* (perhaps it was a looking glass \n",
    "that dissolved into mist) letting us into a world\n",
    "where original ideas not only mattered, but mattered in proportion to \n",
    "how strange and unfamiliar they were. Each new installment of\n",
    "Mathematical Games delivered two things. First, the subject matter would be \n",
    "in some way related to mathematics; and second the narrative would start \n",
    "in familiar territory and rapidly veer off \n",
    "into *ideas new and unexpected*. \n",
    "Gardner introduced us to myriads\n",
    "of logical puzzles, to paradoxes, to fractals,\n",
    "to the emergent exploratory power of the tireless computer,\n",
    "forays into geometry, ... and on and on. But in view of all \n",
    "of this remarkable \n",
    "treasure I could never fathom why Martin Gardner would \n",
    "now and again write about ordinary, pedestrian integers, \n",
    "and so so with \n",
    "considerable genuine enthusiasm. This was a\n",
    "paradox of a different sort: Martin Gardner came from\n",
