# The Fine Print

The introduction to this book is the basic idea. Here are found framework
details,  'the author's view'.


## First the horse, then the cart


This is a book about selected themes in mathematics. It uses computers when repetitive 
actions are enlightening but tedious. It uses Python because it is very readable and
has a very big supporting library.


## My hidden agenda


As mentioned, I am one of an army of people who see that we need more careful thought
in view of the challenges of the world. I chose the metaphor of 'holding open the door 
to an extraordinary world' as an invitation. My hope is that this is not a zero-sum
game, that we may become even more
extraordinary than we already are. But in contrast to, say, pointing out a
rainbow, the process here involves (sometimes considerable) effort. That's the
front end story; but what about the hidden agenda? 


I am holding the door open **also** to convince you that 
holding this door open is itself fun. Perhaps you will develop some 
level of enthusiasm for and facility with being a teacher yourself.
There are not enough good teachers in the world. 
Teaching is a skill. If it is fun and
rewarding we have motivation to develop it; and 
this gives us more opportunities to teach the extraordinary.



## Realness of ideas


Let's pursue trolls a bit more. We are fairly sure that we could walk
the length of this earth and never come upon an actual living troll. But we will
definitely find paintings of them, stories about them, even statues and
sculptures of trolls. The idea of trolls is a real thing; or else I
could not write this sentence. Trolls we can argue and discuss late into the night.


What about a twenty-seven-dimensional box? The paper or screen holding
these words lies flat, has two dimensions. The bus I ride has three physical dimensions.
I know the number after three is four so what in my experience has four dimensions? 
Nothing! I do not have any experience of four dimensions. But I do know that 
shadows have one less dimension than the thing casting the shadow... so what
does a three dimensional shadow of a four-dimensional object look like?
And what about five or six or more dimensions? Let's suppose that, like for trolls,
the idea is valid... but does it lead to anything substantial?


This is really a comment on the premise of this book. The story of the 
Fishing Kid is presented in a manner that could actually happen. It uses
a little finesse, that the silly bus driver's rule does not concern 
'longest dimension' but rather 'implicit dimension' of an object. But
it is essentially a possible scenario. In contrast, the coda at the end 
of the story takes further liberties into boxes
of higher dimension. The idea is real even if building such boxes 
is beyond our present skill.


Let me take a sharp turn now to uncertainty. Presented with a new thing that
radiates uncertainty sets off my personal alarm bells. I tend to back away 
to the familiar and definite. The idea here is to suggest that a degree of
familiarity with the feeling of uncertainty is a useful skill; so it has to
be developed. The approach to that facet of the program here is to present
some new topic and carry it to an open-ended ellipsis as the end point. 
Math textbooks end with problems... how do these function?


Berg, Schoenberg, Krenek, Stravinski, Prokoviev, Mussorgsky


Does the
*idea* of a 27-dimensional box mean such a box can be built? No. Does 
the *idea* of a 27-dimensional box exist? Certainly! Just as ideas about
trolls exist. Is it a useful idea? Well the idea of trolls is very useful
because trolls make excellent adversaries in stories.


Here is my contention: Like a warehouse our minds can store away ideas
that may or may not prove valuable. Some day the idea of a 27-dimensional cube may
come in handy. This is the unbounded nature of ideas.

It is no coincidence that Martin Gardner wrote The Annotated Alice.


## Magic tricks versus Shoulders of giants


There is a joke among geologists...

## Monty Hall: Emily's elegant solution

You are a contestant on a game show. The host (Monty Hall) shows you three boxes, only one of which
has a prize hidden inside. You are allowed to choose one of the boxes. Before its contents are revealed
Monty Hall first opens a different box under which (he knows) there is no prize. Now there are two
un-revealed boxes: The one you chose and the other un-revealed box. Monty now offers you the opportunity
to switch your choice to the other box. What should you do? That is: What is your best strategy assuming
you want to win the prize?

Emily:
Your probability of choosing correctly at the start is clearly 1 in 3. Think of two swimming pools of size 1/3
and size 2/3. You are now sitting in the swimming pool of size 1/3 and the other two boxes are in the other larger
swimming pool. We can agree that the numbers 1/3 and 2/3 represent the probabilities that the actual prize is in the
two respective pools.

Now (after one of the empty boxes is revealed) you have the opportunity to jump into the larger swimming\n",
pool, the one with a probability of 2/3. You do so... and now here is where it gets interesting. If after you\n",
jumped into the bigger pool you had to choose between the two boxes in that pool you would have even chances\n",
of selecting the correct box, the one with the prize.\n",

    "But Monty Hall has conveniently eliminated the wrong choice. You can't possibly make a mistake when you jump\n",
    "into the larger pool and therefore your chances of winning the prize using Emily's strategy will double\n",
    "to 2/3.\n",

## Some problems in graph theory \n",

Terms: A graph is two sets: A set of vertices or dots and a set of lines that connect pairs of vertices. \n",
These lines are usually called *edges*. And by the way the singular of *vertices* is *vertex*.  \n",

Simple graphs have at most one edge between two vertices. They also do not have loops, which are edges that\n",
connect a single vertex back to itself. Unless otherwise stated this part concerns such simple graphs.  \n",

A Hamiltonian *path* passes through each vertex of a graph exactly once.\n",

If one can arrange to make the last vertex the same as the first the Hamiltonian path becomes a Hamiltonian *circuit*.\n",

A Hamiltonian *graph* is one that possesses a Hamiltonian *circuit*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also in case it is not familiar: The *degree* of a vertex is simply the number of edges incident to that vertex.\n",
    "So if one vertex in a graph connects directly to five other vertices via five edges it is said to have degree $5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prove: A graph with $2n$ vertices and $n^2+1$ edges must contain a triangle.\n",
    "* Prove: Suppose you have a graph with an infinite number of vertices; then there is either an infinite set\n",
    "of vertices every two of which are joined by an edge, or there is an infinte set of vertices no two of\n",
    "which are joined by an edge.\n",
    "* Prove: A graph with $n>=4$ vertices and $2n-3$ edges must contain a circuit with a diagonal.\n",
    "* Prove: A graph with $n>=6$ vertices and $3n-5$ edges must contain two circuits which have no vertices in common.\n",
    "* Prove: Every graph with $n$ vertices and $n+4$ edges contains two circuits which have no edges in common.\n",
    "* Prove Dirac's theorem on Hamiltonian circuits: A graph with $n>=3$ vertices in which each vertex\n",
    "has degree at least $n/2$ has a Hamiltonian circuit.\n",
    "* Prove Ore's theorem: If $n>=3$ and, for every pair of vertices that are not joined by an edge, \n",
    "the sum of the degrees is at least $n$ then the graph is Hamiltonian. \n",
    "* Prove Posa's theorem: Let G be a simple graph with $n$ vertices. If for every $k$ in $1<=k<(n-1)/2$ the number of\n",
    "vertices of degree no exceeding $k$ is less than $k4, and if for $n$ odd the number of vertices with degree\n",
    "not exceeding $(n-1)/2$ does not exceed $(n-1)/2$ then G contains a Hamiltonian cycle.\n",

    "## Izzie Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "A student interested in Ms. Halfway suggested a different walking strategy. I have not looked at this \n",
    "in ages so I am tidying up. I do not know if my interpretation of the question is accurate; but I am\n",
    "deferring that to another day with my best guess following. I also commented out the code so that the\n",
    "solutions are not visible at the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The guess of the student's question: What if you go half-way\n",
    "forward, and from there half-way forward again, and then half-way back. \n",
    "Then repeat; so for every half-way back there are two half-way forwards.\n",
    "But I'm not sure what defines the forward and backward points to which we \n",
    "advance / retreat half-way....\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is of course \"where does this strategy land us?\" and it could be generalized. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Treat the rest of this section as un-polished notes on resolving this question... so room for improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at zero and make the initial goal be 1. Walk half way there, call that $x_2$. Call 0 $x_0$ and call 1 $x_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From $x_2$ walk halfway to $x_1$, call that $x_3$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From $x_3$ walk halfway back to $x_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern is then forward - forward - backward. Where do we end up? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Set $a_0 = 1/2$ and $b_0 = 3/4$. Notice that $a_0\\;<\\;b_0$, just for interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $a_1 = {\\frac{1}{8}} \\; \\cdot \\; (2a_0 + 6b_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $b_1= {\\frac{1}{8}} \\; \\cdot \\; (a_0 + 7b_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate using the generalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$a_n = {\\frac{1}{8}} \\; \\cdot \\; (2a_{n-1} + 6b_{n-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$b_n = {\\frac{1}{8}} \\; \\cdot \\; (a_{n-1} + 7b_{n-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This works if you begin with the proper starting values but not the obvious 0 and 1. It is also calculated\n",
    "to ensure that $b > a$ on each iteration. The recursion builds up powers of $1/8$ but the numerators other\n",
    "factor keeps pace and the result stabilizes. \n",

### Additional steps

The first step was to follow the logic from zero and one as the starting values. This resulted in\n",
an alternating inequality: First $b > a$ then $a > b$ then $b > a$ etcetera on each iteration. \n",

That's fine but it also is confusing to set up the rule properly to agree with the original \n",
iteration function. So I tried just drawing the picture in terms of hops... and I realized\n",
what is given in the calculation directly above: Each iteration resets the boundary goals\n",
to be closer and closer together. So this could be parameterized as follows: \n",

$a' = a + \\alpha(b-a)$

$b' = a + \\beta(b-a)$

    "This operates on (0, 1) and produces the $r = 5/7$ end result, no worries. It suggests a general \n",
    "problem 'What is $r(\\alpha, \\beta)$' starting from (0, 1)?'\n",

### Reformulated in a general sort of way\n",

Suppose you live at the origin 0.0 and wish to travel to 1.0 but you always travel a distance 
to your destination which is a fraction a/b. For example Mr. Halfway always travels $1/2$ of 
the way to his destination; so a = 1 and b = 2. 
Once you receive your fractional distance you turn around and head back to where you just left from. 
Again you only go a/b of this distance. Then you stop, turn around, and so on.

Where do you end up?  (This should be an expression in terms of a and b)

What if a and b are both 1?

What if a is greater than b? 

What if you make the clock run backwards: Where did you come from originally?

If a is greater than b does it help you to run the clock backwards?
