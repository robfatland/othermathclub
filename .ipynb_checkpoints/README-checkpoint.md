# The Other Math Club and Python Bytes

# Python Bytes


These are my ideas about Python Bytes for the 2024-2025 school year. I try to
motivate everything but I also consider it all open to discussion and improvement!


For an earlier version of this material see the `python/teaching notes` folder.


## A Starting Activity


> Ms. Halfway lives in a house that is one city block from the Post Office.
> She needs to mail a letter at the Post Office but she can be rather indecisive 
> at times. She begins walking from her house (at say `0.0`) towards the Post
> Office (at say `1.0`)... but she stops when she is just halfway there. Now 
> her location is `0.5`. She decides it is too far and she will return home.
> But wouldn't you know it, she only goes halfway there when she again comes
> to a stop. Now her location is `0.25`. She turns around (now looking towards
> the Post Office) and begins walking back towards `0.5` from `0.25`... but 
> of course stops once she gets halfway there. Now her location is `0.375`. 
> She turns back to face her home once again you see how the process keeps
> repeating. Each journey is shorter and shorter; and eventually it will become
> so short that she is in effect standing in place. When this comes to pass:
> What will her location be?


This little story illustrates a mathematical idea: We are describing a
plausible sequence of events that could continue forever but with a
practical end point. The idea has nothing to do with computer programming...
but it does become tedious to calculate (plus we might make a mistake). 
So it is perfectly reasonable to let the computer do the calculation.
In so doing we are able to learn a few programming ideas along the way. 
And once we have a working program: We can use it to explore related
questions. For example: Where might Mr. Two-thirds wind up?


## Bullet point planning thoughts


- Agree on the club philosophy of operation
    - I recommend the "ideas > calculation > code > experimentation" plan
    - Suggest Units: Four-week blocks devoted to a particular topic
    - Students tend to want to code up games but note these qualifiers:
        - Games that work properly tend to require a fair amount of coding skill
            - This means that a fun idea can become very frustrating
        - Games are potentially a good direction for advanced students
        - Intent on building a game? 
            - Coaches should be involved in the process
            - Start out by writing a simplest-possible game
                - For example: Guess a number from 1 to 100
                    - Write this from the number chooser side
                    - Write this from the number guesser side
                    -Everything good? Now turn to more complicated games


- Highschool Coaches
    - Recruit coaches: Reji knows the way!
        - The HS students are signing up for a number of responsibilities
            - Two workshops
                - Workshop 1: Curriculum and methods (more on this below)
                - Workshop 2: Developing your own curriculum
            - Manage the classroom
                - Dealing with technical issues
                - Dealing with behavior issues (see below on computer games)


- Advertise the club
    - Parent's night (zoom or in person)
        - Be sure to communicate the importance of the Code of Conduct
            - Why it exists
            - Patterns we have seen
            - Limitations of the club: One day per week, many skip weeks
            - Working away from the club
                - We do not expect this; it is not a class with homework
                - Work on your own is the best way to benefit
                - We will do our best to involve projects: You and your friends
                - At the end of the year: Our goal is your self-sufficiency
    - Policy on friends: Yes if possible, shuffle if necessary (see below)
    - What if student went through the club last year and wish to participate again?
        - This usually does not happen but if it does...
            - Create a separate advanced track
            - Get one or more HS coaches to sign up to teach
            - Do some planning; and run with it


- Onboard the students who sign up
    - Students will configure a working computer
        - Do this with your parents
        - Do this before the first club meeting
        - First meeting: We will test your installation to make sure you are good to go
        - Students need Python, a development environment and the turtle graphics module
        - Simplest: install the Python IDE from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - Optional, more advanced: Install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with Python extension
        - Not recommended: Use the school-provided laptop (too slow, too many restrictions)
        - Cloud option: Create an account on [replit](https://repl.it)
            - Advantage: Nothing to install on your computer (runs in a browser)
            - Disadvantage: Probably need your own WiFi hotspot; BSD does not support
        - See the test program section below on what should work properly after installing Python
    - Students sign a code of conduct
        - Seating as directed
        - Do not engage with anything else found in the classroom
        - Return the room to how we found it: Get the ok to leave from the coach
        - Do not leave any items or any sort of a mess in the room
        - Rules of the club concerning friends
        - We do not open our computers until directed
        - We do not play computer games at the club
            - If you really need to play computer games the club will invite you to do so at home
        - The club activities will include some moving and talking
            - You agree to participate with a positive attitude
        - You agree to bring your computer to the club fully charged


- Administrative
    - Get permission from Tyee and the PTSA for the POA
    - Maintain open lines of communication
    - Check in with the Tyee teacher responsible for Python: Any interest in the club?

    - Based on assessment we may need to change what we are doing


## Friends


Students are very enthusiastic about participating with their friends. This can be 
very productive as they will naturally want to help one another. However some
friends-together situations become distracting or worse. I suggest making this
very clear to the students and coaches. Example item in the Code of Conduct:


*"I understand that the club will try to support friends sitting together if possible.
In those cases it is my responsibility to manage the friends-together situation so
that we are engaged and contributing. If on the other hand the Coach sees that we 
are so focused on friends behavior that the club becomes secondary: The Coach may
feel it appropriate to move us apart and I will adhere to this decision."*



## Basic program test


Students should code up the following program and run it to verify their environment 
is working. We publish this in advance (since they are installing a Python IDE) but
we want to see it work in the club space.


```
# this is not complete just yet... (9/1/2024)
import requests
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.forward(100)
input('Hit <enter> to halt')
```



## Skill tiers


The Python Bytes (non-competitive) computing club has run each year at Tyee
Middle School in Bellevue Washington from 2018 onward. Until last year (the 2023-24 
school year) the club placed students into two 'tiers': Tier 1 was intended to 
serve students who were completely new to coding and tier 2 was oriented towards 
students who already had some coding experience. 


In this most recent year the distinction was abandoned because it tended to 
dilute our limited teaching resources. It also broke up friends (which they
do not enjoy) and it deprived the tier 1 students of potential help in
learning the material from their peers. The new assumption for 2023 was 
that all students who join the club are essentially beginning coders. 
This helps in the club's shift to a focus on ideas, described below.


> Note: If a student does have Python skills: It is important to
> invite them to engage with the guides and get help finding
> appropriate challenges.


## Language


We learn a languages on multiple levels; and let's suppose we are 
motivated by some need to communicate so all those levels come together.
Python as a programming language follows this pattern; so the challenge in
the club is to combine motivating ideas with a process of learning the 
basics, the mechanics of coding. Do this with a limited club time of 
75 minutes per week.


Let's assume that details of Python syntax will be picked up by the 
students along the way. We are now free to shift emphasis to ideas and ask:
What are some ideas that produce a good learning experience? 
One such idea is the story of Ms. Halfway.
The Ms. Halfway problem ('Where does she wind up?') has three great 
features. First we can act it out in the classroom. 
Second it can be solved mathematically. And third it can be simulated using
a small amount of Python code.


## Teaching approach


### Part 1 Start with ideas


As noted above we hope to begin with ideas that have nothing to do with
computers or `print` statements. From there we want to dream up
exploratory ideas that translate to calculation. Then and only
then, thirdly, we open our computers and begin writing code.


Once the code works we can solve the problem. However in the spirit of
exploration this is intended as a rewarding starting point. Is our code
able to help us explore other questions? Other ideas?


### Part 2 Methods


Middle school students do not (with some exceptions) have the perseverence 
to simply learn `print` and `while` in a vacuum. Here are some approaches to 
leading the process.


- code along: Instructor writes code on the whiteboard, student copies.
Explanations as we go. Good to get started and get a working result.
Does not get the students self-sufficient
- Solve it: The guide presents a problem to solve via code.
This might be a many-steps / iterative process. Interactively go over
relevant commands. Students work together or individually. Here the idea
is to provide minimal intervention; so working on self-sufficiency.
- Socratic: Instructor chooses a student, asks them a high-level question.
Example: After introducing Ms. Halfway ask "Where does she end up?"
Assuming the student is not sure of the answer: We resort to small leading
questions directed to this student and to other students. By means of these
small steps we eventually arrive at a plan for code that solves the problem.
Very important: No coding until the algorithm is understood.
- Kinesthetic: Activities away from the computer that enact some part of
a source idea. These work well if there is some motion involved and if there
is an opportunity to reach a non-obvious conclusion.


### Part 3 Pedagogy

Python syntax can be deconstructed into (let us say) 20 sub-topics.
These can be organized into a learning sequence. Elements of the 
sequence are then presented and internalized. As an example starting
point we want to begin with *flow* (statements and order of execution),
*information* (variables and data structures) and *bugs* (iterative
development). We might try and solve the task of getting a drink of 
water. 


## Originating from ideas

Consider a three step process:
