### Overview


*'Chaos'* means crazy randomness and disorder in English; but in mathematics it has a more specific meaning. Chaos
in math is based on the idea of a *dynamical system*. So what does this mean? A system for our purposes is an
imaginative model; like something you might put together on a table top using some sticks and glue and pins and string
and maybe an egg and a couple of metal weights and a little race car that you stole from your brother. So there is
a vague idea of a *system* as some stuff brought together. And now to make it *dynamical* just means you set it 
up so that when you give it a push it does something interesting. It changes with time. 


Now that you know what a dynamical system is let's go back to chaos. A chaotic dynamical system is one that
is very very difficult to predict what it will do. In fact what it does depends on how you set it up at the 
start; but very microscopic changes in how you set it up can produce wildly different end results. 


Now what about fractals? Fractals are structures that are similar to themselves on different scales of size.
If you took a stamp of a foot outline and using a bunch of stamping actions drew a picture of a foot: That 
is getting into the idea of fractals. 


Now there is a strange thing about mathematics -- the study of patterns -- that chaos and fractals are connected
together. And this has everything to do with the deep mysteries of the universe that we don't have time to explain 
here. But I did want to tell you just these few terms { 'chaos', 'dynamical system', 'mathematics', 'fractal' }
so that you would have little buzzy wires with sparks coming out in your mind
as you work on this project. If the word 'philosophy' means 'understanding of the universe' then the famous quote 
related to how we don't learn everything all at once goes like this: 


> There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
