## Egon is stumbling home in bluing and rags


Egon is a painter and a central character. His full name is Egon Byzkn.
He is fictional.
It must also be said of Egon that while he does not have a great deal of initiative,
he does have an extraordinary ability to persevere. Once he gets an idea in his head 
he will keep after it, for much longer than most people would. Egon has a friend named 
Kyd; whose last name is Pypkn. She is rather the opposite
of Egon in some ways: She has a wealth of ideas and initiative but 
she tends to appear rather busy,
particularly busy with her homework... to be honest she can be a little impatient.


Most mornings around 9:30 or so Egon and Kyd have coffee in the piazza, the public square 
at the center of the town where they live, a town called Monte Carlo. 


One evening Egon is stumbling home (he is rather uncoordinated, more so in the later stages
of the evening) when he passes a restaurant. Really it is a pub; but they serve curry with 
rice. In this pub there is a television, and the television shouts at Egon as he walks by:  
'... Something Something Something Binomial Theorem Something Something!!'
Egon ignores this, continues walking, arrives home and falls asleep.


The next morning Egon sits across from Kyd at an al fresco cafe in the piazza. 
She seems to be working on a homework problem that involves writing many rows 
of zeros across a piece of paper. Egon clears his throat.

'A television said "Binomial Theorem" at me last night", observes Egon. "Do you have any notion of what 
that means?"


"Certainly!" responded Kyd. She writes down on a fresh sheet of paper ${( \alpha  +  \beta )}^n$.


Egon stares at this for a moment. "What is the $\alpha$ you have here?"


"Oh that's the beauty of the binomial theorem: $\alpha$ can be anything you like."


Egon stares for a few more moments. "And $\beta$? I suppose $\beta$ can be anything as well?"


"Of course!" responded Kyd. "Now you're getting the hang of it!"


Egon makes a nonplussed face and then a dogged face; and continues: 'And is $n$ anything I like as well?' 


'Oh no' she replied. $n$ is a positive integer... or it can be zero. So $n$ can be zero or one or 
two or three or four... and so on like that.'


'So $/alpha$ is anything, $/beta$ is anything, and $n$ is 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. 
Why is there no *equal* sign? Isn't this math? I recall there was supposed to 
be an *equal* sign lurking about somewhere... it was some time ago.'


'Yes there is an equals, if you like.'


'Well so what is it equal to?' asks Egon. 


Kyd Pypkn finishes writing another row of zeros on her homework -- this time there are a few ones as well -- 
and then she says,
'Well suppose $n$ is 2. Then you have $\alpha + \beta$ squared, and this ***Equals*** 
$\alpha^2 + 2 \cdot \alpha \cdot \beta + \beta^2$.'


'But where did the $\alpha$ go in the $\beta^2$?' asks Egon.


'Oh it's still there; but it is raised to only the zero power... so that is just 1 and we do not bother writing it down.'


'Ah', said Egon, starting to get the idea, '...so then really the complete version looks like so:...' 
and he wrote down: 


$$
(\alpha + \beta)^2 = 1 \cdot \alpha^2 \cdot \beta^0 + 2 \cdot \alpha \cdot \beta + 1 \cdot \alpha^0 \cdot \beta^2
$$


'Yes, just so,' said Kid Pipkin. 'And the result change if you change $n$ from 2 to something else, like 5.'
