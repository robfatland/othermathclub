# Consecutive Partitions

A *partition* of a number means breaking it down into a sum of pieces.
A consecutive partition expresses a number ***n*** as the sum of consecutive 
integers. For example ***18*** is equal to the consecutive partition ***3 + 4 + 5 + 6***.
I will stipulate that a consecutive partition consists of one or more positive 
integers; so every number ***n*** is a trivial consecutive partition of itself.
***6*** has two consecutive partitions: ***6*** and ***1 + 2 + 3***.


How many consecutive partitions does an arbitrary number ***n*** have?


## Suggestion for getting started


You may wish to count the consecutive partitions for all the numbers 
from ***1*** to say ***30*** or so.
