    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought I'd take a run at analytic number theory as a self-study 'course'\n",
    "by means of Professor Apostol's fine book. I last had the privilege of \n",
    "enjoying his lectures in person in 1984; whence once upon a time I and my \n",
    "fellow classmates affectionately referred to him (or his calculus books,\n",
    "depending on context) as *Tommy*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My observation on starting to work through this book: I found I \n",
    "understood the basic theorems and proofs on a 'check mark' level.\n",
    "They made perfect sense but were not truly internalized. This hit \n",
    "home as I dug into the exercises, where I hit a brick wall with \n",
    "even the simplest of chapter 1, let alone those of chapter 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After a time when various attempts got me little progress I decided\n",
    "to look for some guidance on the web; which led me to a partial set\n",
    "of solutions by Sean Li and a full set by Greg Hurst. These proved\n",
    "to be an excellent resource; and as long as they are available online\n",
    "as pdfs they might be seen as an alternative to course lectures. \n",
    "All solutions found here -- unless otherwise noted -- should be taken\n",
    "as 'directly from Greg's and/or Sean's work', albeit through \n",
    "the lens of my interpretive process. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this regard I'm writing up these notes for my own amusement, in\n",
    "particular to record ideas and methods that are implicit in the work\n",
    "of Messrs. Li and Hurst. As an example it is one thing to multiply\n",
    "$c \\; \\times \\; 1$ as a triviality but quite another knowing that\n",
    "$(a, b) = 1$ to multiply $c \\cdot (ax + by)$ for some $x$ and $y$ \n",
    "as a productive step in a proof. So away we go here, in the spirit\n",
    "of an annotative look at Apostol's Introduction to Analytic Number\n",
    "Theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of solution\n",
    "\n",
    "'Ducking the wave' is possible for some problems. An elegant solution might be \n",
    "intended by the author (see the occasional *hint*) that makes use of theorems \n",
    "and reasoning. I often start problems by working examples; and this can turn \n",
    "up patterns that suggest a *mechanical* rather than *theoretical* solution. \n",
    "Less elegant and less powerful. Working cases for problem 2.5, for example,\n",
    "turns up a kind of empirical combinatoric solution... but at the moment I do \n",
    "not have a complete justification. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some solutions in chapter 1 I have skimped on, falling back on writing an \n",
    "integer $n > 1$ as $\\prod_{i=1}^{k}{p_i}^{a_i}$ and then reasoning about \n",
    "the statement to be proved. Again this feels mechanical but 'let me not\n",
