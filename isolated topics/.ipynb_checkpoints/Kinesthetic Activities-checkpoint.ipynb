    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "I accidentally discovered kinesthetic activities when teaching Astronomy at a science camp; \n",
    "when it rained one evening. Since then the practice has been the most engaging thing we've \n",
    "tried by far. The real trick is converting the enthusiasm it engenders into real focused\n",
    "introspective work. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Source \n",
    "\n",
    "- The book _Solve This_\n",
    "- The book _Which Way Did The Bicycle Go?_ \n",
    "- Honsberger, particularly Gems I II III (IV?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activity and Assignment Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "- Counting spirals: Sunflowers, daisies, pine cones, ... what else? ...\n",
    "- Hat problems: Red and Black non-facecards read well to the house when the student holds the card against the back of their head. There is no way they can accidentally see what color they have; but anyone behind them sees it easily.\n",
    "- A Candy Game\n",
    "  - Everyone in a circle has a random but even number of wrapped pieces of candy\n",
    "  - In rounds:\n",
    "      - Give half your candy to the person on your left\n",
    "      - Receive a supply of candy from the person your right: simultaneously\n",
    "      - Now recount your candy supply\n",
    "      - If you now have an odd number of pieces take an extra from the reserve \n",
    "      - Repeat\n",
    "  - How many pieces of candy were there at the start? End? \n",
    "  - Instead: \"Eat\" the odd pieces to make your pile even again\n",
    "  - Give half your candy to the person on your left and the other half to the person on your right\n",
    "  - This sort of stopping problem is related to the ring problem and the Collatz conjecture\n",
    "    - It also lends itself to a fairly easy programming exercise\n",
    "- Expert Game\n",
    "    - This is a concept but I do not know how to put it into practice\n",
    "    - The idea is to demonstrate logical fallacy in action\n",
    "    - possible logical fallacies include...\n",
    "        - *proof by assertion*\n",
    "        - *proof by appeal to authority*\n",
    "        - *disproof by questioning character*\n",
    "        - *proof by assuming the conclusion* \n",
    "    - It might require advance preparation and some language misdirection\n",
    "    - Example: Expert says \"Humans are error-riddled copies of a computer program\"\n",
    "        - To back this up requires quite a bit of preparation\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anticipating Meru Prastarah\n",
    "    - How many subsets are there for a set of five students?\n",
    "    - Symmetry of counting yes / no versus no / yes\n",
    "    - Bits and a binary number system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two famous mathematicians -- Ulam and Von Neumann -- invented a method of exploring ideas called **Monte Carlo**.\n",
    "- The method uses random numbers; hence 'chance', hence the name\n",
    "- We can simulate Monte Carlo by handing out some dice and recording sums\n",
    "    - Push back the desks, let's use the floor...\n",
    "    - Roll 3 dice, shout out the sum, repeat: One person tallies a histogram\n",
    "    - Can also solve exactly\n",
    "- Experiment gets progressively closer to theory\n",
    "- Meaning of **theory** and **experiment**...\n",
    "- Contrast meaning of **abstract** and **definite**\n",
    "- Calculate $\\pi$ with darts...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's talk lines, triangles and circles\n",
    "- A line grazes a circle. Is it possible to touch at only one point? What is the angle?\n",
    "- Two circles can touch at only one point? What is the angle? of the two radii at the tangent?\n",
    "- What does it mean, the center of a triangle? There are at least three centers...\n",
    "- How do we get the area of a triangle?\n",
    "- What is $C/d$? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Two ideas\n",
    "    * Infinities that go outward and get very large. You can count them perhaps... but you never finish.\n",
    "    * Infinities that go on forever but grow smaller and smaller... so they add to something *not* infinite\n",
    "* This is missing a good kinesthetic activity\n",
    "    * Hilbert hotel would involve a lot of students... possible but I'm a little skeptical on how\n",
    "    * Bugs is definitely workable (start at at least 10 feet, 20 is better)\n",
    "        * But an infinite number of diagonal crossings is a little hard to get across\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "- We begin by defining a thing\n",
    "    - A **thing** is a thing. \n",
    "        - It can't be defined without using another word that is just a synonym for *thing*\n",
    "- A **set** is a collection of things. \n",
    "    - Label: $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, ..., v_n\\}$)\n",
    "- A **graph** is two sets: A set of **things** $V$ and a set of pairs of things from $V$ we call $E$\n",
    "- Act this out to arrive at pictures of graphs\n",
    "    - One set of students is **things**\n",
    "    - A non-thing student acts as a pairer of **things**: Touch the arm of both. 'Linker'\n",
    "        - Now add another linker and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G=(V,E)=(\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, ...\\}, \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_3, v_5), ...\\})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notice that this *thing* here and this *thing* here are connected. \n",
    "    - So the first *thing* has a name $v_1$...\n",
    "    - ...but we can also point to it and say it is that *thing* connected to this other *thing*. \n",
    "    - Just as you know my *name* but you also know me as *acquaintance of Ms.H*. \n",
    "- Equivalence between writing out the sets and drawing the picture of the graph\n",
    "    - Differentiate this from a rigid geometrical figure\n",
    "- Enact: An odd number of people are at a party\n",
    "    - Let's have everyone shake hands an odd number of times \n",
    "    - You may not refuse a handshake and you may not shake hands with yourself\n",
    "    - Place your non-shake hand in the air if you are currently odd-count of shakes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numbers and Diophantus\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kinesthetic part: Not written up yet\n",
    "- **Diophantus 240 Fermat 1640 Wiles 1994**\n",
    "- There are certain problems that *require* whole number answers\n",
    "- Barnyard cows and chickens... 42 legs and 42 ears\n",
    "    - How many chickens are there? \n",
    "    - Describe your method\n",
    "    - What does a negative chicken look like?\n",
    "- Do all problems play fair? \n",
    "    - Try again with 100 legs and 42 ears: How many chickens?\n",
    "- Problems that have whole number solutions are called Diophantine problems, after Diophantus. \n",
    "- Diophantus wrote *Arithemetica* in AD240... a book of math problems and solutions...\n",
    "    - ...and 1400 years later while reading a copy of this book Pierre de Fermat\n",
    "claimed that there are no positive integer solutions to $a^n+b^n=c^n$ for $n>2$... \n",
    "    - He said he had a proof but it would not fit in the margin\n",
    "        - ...and this claim of Fermat was shown to be true in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, 354 years later\n",
    "- $n=2$ looks like Pythagoras\n",
    "    - But not possible for bigger exponents?\n",
    "- What is an easy way of figuring out if some big number is divisible by 9?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative One Squared\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kinesthetic idea is to lay out a 2D coordinate plane / unit circle 20 feet across...\n",
    "    - ...but pretend it is just a number line at the outset\n",
    "    - We will do the multiply game: Two people represent two numbers\n",
    "        - When they are multiplied they have to agree where they go\n",
    "    - Place someone at 1, someone else at 1, now multiply yourselves!\n",
    "    - Now two at -1, same\n",
    "    - Now two people at 1 and -1; then -1 and 1\n",
    "    - Now let's do some square roots: Stand here at 1, and now go backwards to the same spot to be square roots...\n",
    "    - Now what? \n",
    "- We can redefine a **number** to be **anything that follows the rules of arithmetic**\n",
    "- Call pairs of regular numbers: **doublized numbers**\n",
    "    - Now we can place two people on the two axes and have them meet in the plane\n",
    "- How to add? How to multiply? \n",
    "    - Yes, a new number system!\n",
    "- Treat real numbers as doublized numbers with the second number zero\n",
    "    - Now we have a basis for -1 x 1\n",
    "    - Now we have a basis for square root 1, of which there are two; and so on\n",
