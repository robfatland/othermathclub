    "## Rolling a single die to motivate the pdf\n",
    "    \n",
    "I know about three things in the topic of probability. The first is that a probability is\n",
    "a number between zero to one inclusive; and is somehow connected to the outcomes of unpredictable \n",
    "of ('in the future') events. This is a staple idea in what follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing is the use of averaging to arrive at an expectation. An expectation\n",
    "is a number that applies to a probability experiment that is is run over and over again\n",
    "under identical conditions. The idea is to determine how the experiment will come out\n",
    "on average; 'How we expect the experiment to turn out.' The third thing I know\n",
    "about is called a moment-generating function... but I've forgotten what that is at the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "So let's begin with the second idea, the averaging process\n",
    "to get an expectation, making use of the first idea, the basic concept of \n",
    "a probability as a number from zero to one inclusive. \n",
    "Let's describe a slow way and a couple of faster ways of calculating an\n",
    "expectation. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### method 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment: I have a dice with six faces. I want to know how many times I need \n",
    "to roll it, on average, for it to come up 6. I start rolling it until it comes up \n",
    "six; and this requires let us suppose five rolls. That is my result; so I write down \n",
    "\"5\". That was experiment 1. I do this experiment a second time; and it requires \n",
    "seven rolls to get a six; so I write down \"7\". I continue until I have done 20,000\n",
    "such experiments, and 20,000 corresponding numbers, which I will call scores.\n",
    "From this experimental data I calculate the average. I add up all the scores \n",
    "and divide by 20,000. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The result will be close to 6. This is sensible, since there are six possible outcomes\n",

    "    \n",

    "### method 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I do the experiment a second time. It will be the same average but by\n",
    "slightly different means: I draw \n",
    "a stack of empty boxes on a piece of paper. I label them 1, 2, 3, 4 and \n",
    "so on up to say 100. Now I start a first experiment: I count the number of rolls\n",
    "needed to get a first 6. Suppose it takes two rolls; so I have a score of 2.\n",
    "I put a tally mark in\n",
    "the box labelled '2'. And as before I do this scoring process 20,000 times. \n",
    "When I am done\n",
    "I will have 20,000 tick marks distributed among the various boxes. So I count the\n",
    "tick marks in each box and write that number next to the box. Now it is time\n",
    "to get the average. There are, let's suppose, 3419 tick marks in the '1' \n",
    "box. I'm summing the scores; so I add ones: 3419 times. In the score = 2 box \n",
    "there are 3088 tick marks; so to my running sum I add 2 x 3088. And so on. \n",
    "Each box has a score and a tick mark count; and I simply multiply them\n",
    "and add that to the total. Once again at the end \n",
    "I divide by 20,000 to get the average score, or the expectation for how many\n",
    "rolls it takes to get a 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### method 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to do the experiment one more time. As before I set up \n",
    "the tick mark boxes with score labels; I fill these boxes variously \n",
    "with 20,000 tick marks, one per experiment. I tally up the tick marks \n",
    "in each score box and \n",
    "write that tally next to its box. Now the difference: \n",
    "I divide each tally by 20,000. This means there will be no division \n",
    "by 20,000 as the last step: The averaging is built into these \n",
    "tally / 20,000 fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The tick mark tally for each box has become a fraction of the total number \n",
    "of 20,000 tick marks. \n",
    "These fractions necessarily add to one. Each fraction is an observed \n",
    "probability of getting that score when rolling a dice. \n",
    "Now, in this third version of the experiment, once the tick mark counts are \n",
    "divided by 20,000, the resulting probabilities are multiplied by\n",
    "their respective scores; \n",
    "and these products are added up to arrive at the average.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### method equivalence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now imagined doing the experiment 3 times. These three calculations are\n",
    "identical and the procedures vary slightly. The point is to make the case that\n",
    "they *are* identical while finding a further use for 'method 3' that invoked \n",
    "the idea of a set of probabilities associated with each score. The probabilities\n",
    "act as weights; so method 3 calculates a weighted average. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The organized\n",
    "listing of probabilities by score can be seen as a discrete function. \n",
    "'Discrete' means it has\n",
    "values at integral scores: 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on. There is no value of\n",
    "this function for 3.2: We have no way of rolling a dice 3.2 times. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "This discrete function is called a probability distribution function, \n",
    "abbreviated **pdf**. It serves\n",
    "two purposes. First it works in the above story to illustrate a way\n",

    "to get a dice to turn up 6 (or 5 or 4 or ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second purpose of the probability distribution function is to enable \n",
    "using theoretical probabilities to determine expectations. That is, \n",
    "if we do not want to actually conduct 20,000 experiments (which are rather\n",
    "time consuming) we can instead calculate probabilities for various outcomes,\n",
    "multiply those probabilities by the outcome scores, and add the results\n",

    "PDFs can represent idealized perfect experiments; or they can be produced observationally\n",
    "by running actual experiments. As an obvious example the PDF for a single die roll with\n",
    "six possible outcomes is $\\{ 1: 1/6, \\; 2: 1/6, \\; 3: 1/6, \\; 4: 1/6, \\;5: 1/6, \\;6: 1/6 \\; \\} $ \n",

    "#### Motivating the pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A probability experiment can suggest questions about the outcome. Above \n",
    "we had two such questions:  'What is the probability, on rolling $N$ dice,\n",
    "that at least two come up $6$?' and 'How many rolls of a single dice do we \n",
    "expect are needed on average to get a 3?' The term *expectation* is used\n",
    "for many types of 'expected outcome' questions. This is an open \n",
    "door from probability into\n",
    "statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A good PDF is instrumental to calculating an expected outcome \n",
    "(or *expectation*). Why is this so?  First I'll give a simple \n",
    "definition of expected outcome; and then let's do a constructive\n",
    "excercise to motivate the value of the pdf. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectation $E$ is a weighted sum over outcomes of the quantity of interest: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E = \\sum_i Quantity(i) \\cdot PDF(i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PDF value part one: A tedious experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's *calculate* an expectation value for an experiment. We run the experiment \n",
    "many times to determine the average outcome. Let's continue with this question:\n",
    "How many times should we expect to roll a single die for it to come up three? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We play the game once and it requires 7 rolls. \n",
    "- We play a second time and it requires 2 rolls. \n",
    "- The third time: 84 rolls, a string of bad luck. \n",
    "- And so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After each experiment we write the number of rolls it took. We do this experiment 20,000 times. \n",
    "Our results look like $\\;7, 2, 84, 19, 3, 1, 5, 8, 2, 1, 14, ... , 17\\;$. There are 20,000 such results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the average: Add up all 20,000 results and divide by 20,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PDF value part two: tick boxes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin rolling our dice, we create a tally sheet of empty numbered boxes. \n",
    "Beside the tally boxes are numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on up to say 100.\n",
    "These numbers represent how many rolls are required to finish a given experiment. \n",
    "We do the same experiment 20,000 times but now after each one we make a tally\n",
    "mark in the appropriate tick box. When an experiment requires 14 rolls to\n",
    "get a six we put a tally mark in box 14. (We can add more boxes if we have \n",
    "really poor luck getting that 3.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now with 20,000 trials the averaging process is simpler. Suppose tick box \"1\" has 3,419 \n",
    "tick marks. Rather than adding up \"1\" 3,419 times (as we did in Step One) we just multiply 1 x 3,419 to \n",
    "get 3,419. If box \"2\" has 2,977 marks we add (2977 * 2) to our total. And so on for tick boxes 3, 4, \n",
    "etcetera. If tick box 7 has 219 marks: Add 7 * 219 to the total. The tick boxes make the sum easier. \n",
    "At the end: Suppose the grand total is 121,432. Just as before divide by 20,000 to get the \n",
    "expectation, the expected number of rolls required to get a 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we are looking at the 100 tally boxes. The first box will have the most ticks, the second box \n",
    "fewer, the third box fewer still, and so on. The early boxes shadow the later ones. The result looks \n",
    "like a long tail getting smaller as the tick box numbers get larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence of numbers is a probability distribution: It is more likely to take three rolls to get 3\n",
    "than it is to need 41 rolls. One thing distinguishes this numerical sequence from a PDF, however: \n",
    "If the values in the tally boxes are numbers like 3,419 and 2,753 and so on, they do not add up to one. \n",
    "That is, they are relative probabilities, not absolute probabilities in the \"zero to one\" range. \n",
    "We can fix that next. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PDF value three: normalizing the probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A third time we set out to do this experiment. As before we set up tick boxes. As before we run\n",
    "20,000 experiments. Now before summing up tally marks x box number: Divide each of the tally mark\n",
    "numbers by 20,000. Since there are 20,000 tally marks in total, this gives us 20,000 fractions that \n",
    "sum to 1. This is a probability distribution function, a sequence of 100 numbers between 0 \n",
    "and 1 representing experimental probabilities for rolling a 3 after so many rolls. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation is now the sum of (probability for tick box i) x (i). There is no division by 20,000\n",
    "step as we did that above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\;E = \\sum_i i \\cdot \\frac{tally \\; score(tick \\; box \\; i)}{20,000} = \\sum_i i \\cdot PDF(i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case that we can come up with an accurate pdf just by *thinking*: We do not need to\n",
    "do the 20,000 experiments. We can just calculate the sum. Of course it is nice to run the \n",

Then we can verify that this PDF sums to 1 and then try and calculate $T_N$.  In this more general case the result may not be quite so pretty... we shall see. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the double sum that follows note that the index $t$ runs from 1 to $\\infty$ being the number of throws needed to finish the game, and the index $i$ runs from $1$ to $N$, the number of dice we play the game with. Since the pdf is a function of throw number (what is the probability of finishing the game on throw $t$) it is written as $pdf_N(t)$ for a game of Sixes that begins with $N$ dice. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I first describe the form of the PDF: Suppose that the game is to end on throw $t$. Then there are between one and $N$ dice remaining after $t-1$ throws, i.e. $N$ cases to consider. For each case there is a certain probability of the game ending on throw $t$.  \n",

This is a sum over the number of ways to finish the game on throw $t$. In other words the PDF is the sum of $N$ individual probabilities of finishing on throw $t$ that account for all the ways of ''not'' having finished the game after the previous $t-1$ throws.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than bulldoze ahead to a form for the PDF I would like to proceed a little bit more retrograde as it makes the writing easier to do. So I will claim that the PDF can conveniently be written as a sum (over $N$ dice) of the product of four functions, to be elaborated in a bit: $pdf_N(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^N F_1(i) \\cdot F_2(i) \\cdot F_3(i, t) \\cdot F_4(i, t)$\n",

    "So here we get to go through the justification. $F_1$ is the probability of rolling $i$ sixes on throw $t$. $F_2$ is the number of ways of choosing those $i$ dice from among $N$. Hence the remaining two functions multiplied together had better give the probability of winding up with $i$ dice after $t-1$ throws.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact if we assume that exactly $i$ dice have survived to throw $t$ (and we've already accounted for the number of ways of selecting them) the last two factors $F_3$ and $F_4$ are respectively the probabilities that the $i$ dice never came up $6$ and the remaining $N - i$ dice each came up $6$ at least once in $t-1$ throws. So in words the probability of finishing the game precisely on throw $t$ is the sum of $N$ ways of winning on throw $t$, where the index $i$ in this sum is the number of dice that have survived to throw $t$ without ever coming up six, and where to win on throw $t$ they must all come up six on that throw. In order to reach these $i$ dice remaining, first they must never have come up six in $t-1$ throws, and the remaining $N - i$ dice must all have come up six at least once in $t - 1$ throws. \n",

She wishes to hire $N$ of them and to make the problem simple we assume they each have the same probability $a$ of saying Yes when offered the job. She begins at the top of her list and offers the job in order to people until she has $N$ yesses. The problem is stated one way like this: How many people do we expect will get offered the job? \n",

    "\n",
    "### MEX-EX and Bayes Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make an observation '''A''' and suppose that this is somehow (perhaps?) causally connected to a set of driving conditions <math>B = {B_i}</math>. Furthermore suppose that those conditions are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, hence MEX-EX (my term). The connection between A and B is not deterministic but rather probabilistic. For example A might be the temperature of an outdoor thermometer and the B's might be seasons. This situation is the set-up for both the theorem of Bayes and for a system of inferring information in a probabilistic setting called ''Bayesian Inference''. And Bayesian Inference is carried to a broader set of ideas called Bayesian Analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First point: MEX-EX seems to be a (useful) analog to a pdf: The sum of <big><math>P(B_i)</math></big> must be 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Second point: There is an implicit model relating dependent probabilities that works in both directions. Or it should eventually become an explicit model, case by case. One of the important ideas here is that the model itself is up for grabs: It might be good, it might be lousy; and we try and let the data tell us which within the Bayesian framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This derives from the definition of the probability of both A and Bi occurring, written P(A, Bi). I won't bother formatting Bi to save time. Clearly P(A, Bi) = P(A|Bi) x P(Bi). The probability of the temperature being 5 deg C and it being winter is the probability of a 5 deg temperature when it is winter (estimated at 0.05) times the probability that it ''is'' winter (at an arbitrary date this is 0.25). So that gives me a probability of it being 5 deg C and winter as 1/80.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I will say, by the way, that both temperature and season are ''states'' of the system (the authors say 'of nature'); but they stick with the idea that A is an observation and {Bi} are the MEX-EX states. I arbitrarily state that in winter the temperature is between -9 and +10 each with equal probability; so that is how I got to 1/20. But do I believe that the chances that it is winter and 5 deg are 1/80? Let's do the same with two dice. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the chances of box cars? 1/36. P(6|6) = 1/6 and P(6) = 1/6 so that works for independent events. I think the idea is ok for now. So onward with a particular Bi:\n",

    "\n",
    "P(Bi, A) = P(A, Bi) is ok.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So P(Bi|A) = P(A|Bi)P(Bi)/P(A) is ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And then finally we say that the some of all conditional probabilities for A over the various B's is, in total, the probability of A since the B's are MEX-EX. That's only fair. So now that's Bayes' Theorem.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Inference follows: Your dependency model across all MEX-EX states is the characterization of reality that determines probabilities of independent states given your observation A. What is your model? It is a set of two probability distributions: P(A|Bi) and P(Bi) for all I."
