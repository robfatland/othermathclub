The other math club began at a middle school in 2017 as an exploration of 
interesting ideas intended for 11-to-13-year-old students. After two years it
transformed into more computer programming emphasis, becoming "Python Bytes".
As of 2024 Python Bytes continues...

The biggest hurdle this project faces is that the club meets once per week
(with skips when the school calendar interferes) and the participants are 
not "on the hook" to deliver the results of their own effort. It is, after
all, intended as a club. 


The motivating concepts have evolved and are encapsulated in this little diagram.

In translation: We begin with ideas rather than Python syntax. We think about those ideas
and arrive eventually at a calculation; and this is then translated to code. Once the code
is written: We hope to experiment with it. In a perfect world this provides some insight
into the original idea.


Meanwhile we *do* learn Python syntax along the way; and we also practice communicating
our ideas, comprehensions and questions about the subject matter. Finally the students 
need to have support at home.
