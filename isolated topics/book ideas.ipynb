    "The book is also inspired by the National Research Council book _How People Learn_ which indicates that without a context web it is well nigh impossible to build an understanding of a subject. To put this another way: Some students, a small fraction, have the innate quality of initiative. They build context webs under their own power and they can sail through books by Martin Gardner having the time of their life. This book will -- I hope -- serve them some interesting material for that process; but this book is written for the person who might like the *idea* of being a mathematician but who has no idea how to proceed.\n",
    "\n",

    "I would like to provide a practical anecdote from my own experience. This has happened to me many many times: I read through a book on mathematics, I find a particular problem, and I set to work. The problem involves perhaps a myriad of possible solutions and I begin following up a particular idea. This turns into some algebra and suddenly I am expanding infinite sums of polynomials simply writing out line after line of symbols like an automaton; only to run aground on the shores of the Mare Insolvus. (need the proper Latin here; ask David Beck) (this sea goes on the map) Then I sit back and realize that the original author posed the problem precisely because there is an Aha solution… so I finally allow myself to relax and think about that. And within a few minutes the solution appears. This happened for the Gardner problem concerning the worm going through the 3 x 3 x 3 cube. I could tell the problem could be represented as a path through a graph but I became caught up in drawing the \n",
    "graph which prevented me from noticing the key idea that the worm alternates between edges and (faces or corners). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the middle school level: In 7th or 8th grade students are taught to work through 'algebraic equations' following the \n",
    "order of operations and the distributive principle and so on. Solve for $x$. But their noses can get very close to the\n",
    "page and they miss the opportunity to speed up the process by sitting back for a look at the bigger picture. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do not want is to only solve Aha problems. We want to solve extended problems--what I call hikes--with extended diligence of effort.  The nature of the hike, ideally, is to cover some different types of terrain and to arrive somewhere familiar at the end; 'back at the car'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining mathematics as 'the exploration (invention?) of patterns using imagination, curiosity and reason' is intended as\n",
    "leverage to broaden perspective beyond classrooms and homework problems. Math class is to mathematics as a song is to music.\n",
    "Again there is a balance: How much of this high-falutin' has value versus takes up space? A good approach would be to read\n",
    "a bunch of Prefaces and see 'did this do enough / too much to set the tone?' \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a sports metaphor at work here as well, one that raises a difficult problem for the author. A basketball team plays a game and loses; and the team members reflect. Was the loss due to experiences in previous games, one game per week? Perhaps. But more important might be what happened in practice two nights per week over the season. But no: What really mattered was what did or did not happen every single day. Did the players go outside in their backyard or on the sidewalk and practice dribbling the ball? Shooting against the side of a building? Passing back and forth for hours with a friend? Sprinting down to the corner of the block, resting for ten seconds, and doing it again… and again… and again… until that became easier… and then going two blocks. In short: Repetitions help solidify our skills. The road through the mathematics landscape that is the school curriculum is full of repetitions. There is no substitute for 99.99% of us for doing hundreds or thousands of algebra problems. If you write down x you should automatically know you could also write that as $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x}}$.  \n",

    "Miss Halfaway never finishes what she sets out to do. One day she decides to walk from Zero to One on the real number line. But after setting out she gets as far as 1/2 and decides to go no further. Looking back she decides to return to Zero but again only makes it halfway, stopping at 1/4. She turns around again and decides to go back to 1/2. But you guessed it: She only makes it half way and stops at 3/8. By continuously reversing direction and proceeding in this manner she eventually arrives at a particular location on the real number line. Where does she end up? What does it mean to 'arrive at a specific location' by making an infinite number of progressively shorter journeys? \n",

Please write those down, crumple up the paper and toss it into the trash. These problems require you to abandon practical thinking, and this is one of the many freedoms of mathematics. When you\n",

    "in a very fine British household with a large drawing room. It was winter, there was a nice fire in the\n",
    "fireplace, and she had some kittens to play with. In short she had it made. But there was a large mirror\n",
    "or as they say 'looking glass' above the mantle of the fireplace; and in this mirror she could see a \n",
    "reflection of the room that she was in. And being a persistently curious child... which is quite common \n",
    "I'm told... she began to wonder if the image in the mirror might not simply be another room entirely that \n",
    "just happened to look like a reversed version of the room she was in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alice conveniently ignored the reflection of herself as she gazed into the looking glass. Instead she \n",
    "focused on parts of the room that were not shown there, for example down below the mantlepiece: Was \n",
    "there a fire burning in the other room as well? Would the books on those shelves contain the same \n",
    "stories or different ones? And so pondering she eventually climbed up on the mantlepiece and stepped\n",
    "through the looking glass and into the other room to find out. (The glass had become tenuous like \n",
    "mist.) As she proceeded to explore she was very gratified to find that some of her guesses were \n",
    "accurate. Things were different in the looking glass world, particularly the things that she could not \n",
    "see from her vantage in the usual world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually -- after some interesting passages -- Alice managed to look out upon the landscape outside\n",

    "of the landscape she was promoted to become a queen.\n",
    "\n",

    "  - Hint: Everyone involved in this puzzle has a valid thought process; and that is the key to the problem.\n",
    "  - Short solution: If 1 and 2 have identical hats 3 knows everything. If 1 and 2 have different hats 3 remains silent… but after some silence 2 will realize her hat must differ from that hat of 1; so she can successfully call out the color of her hat.\n",
