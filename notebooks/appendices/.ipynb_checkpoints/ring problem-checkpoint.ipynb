    "# A ring problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is stated in a simplified form compared to how I originally heard it. \n",
    "A more general version might substitute 'real number' for 'integer' and 'positive sum'\n",
    "for 'sum = 1' in what follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set up\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An ordered set of $n$ integers sums to 1. These integers are placed in a ring called $R_n$ \n",
    "so that the last integer is adjacent to the first. Each number location on the ring \n",
    "we call a *site*, usually indexed $0, 1, \\dots, n-1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The ring is repeatedly subjected to an operation called a *flip*: \n",
    "A negative number in the ring is selected by some means and its sign is \n",
    "reversed. For example a -7 becomes +7 which means that 14 has been added\n",
    "to the ring sum. To keep the ring sum constant 7 is then subtracted from\n",
    "both neighboring sites. Here is a complete example (noting $0$\n",
    "is adjacent to $4$):\n",
    "The ring $\\;\\;\\; 0, \\; -2, \\; -1, \\; 3, \\; 5, \\; 4\\;\\;\\;$ has two available flips: \n",
    "The $-2$ and the $-1$. Upon flipping it becomes either\n",
    "$\\;\\;\\;-2, \\; 2, \\; -3, \\; 3, \\; 5, \\; 4\\;\\;\\;$ or $\\;\\;\\;0, \\; -3, \\; 1, \\; 2, \\; 5, \\; 4\\;\\;\\;$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If no negative values are present the ring is said to be *quiescent* or in\n",
    "state $Q$: There are no available flps. A ring might be subjected to $q$ flips \n",
    "to arrive at $Q$. Given that the ring includes only integers that sum to 1: \n",
    "$Q$ must consist of $n-1$ zeros and one $1$ found at one of the $n$ sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Show $R_n \\; _{\\overrightarrow{flips}} \\; Q$. In other words: \n",
    "Prove that if you keep flipping negative-valued sites then quiescence is inevitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Spoiler alert\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point onward is slightly varnished work on solving the problem. \n",
    "If you would like to enjoy solving it yourself then read no further; you have all the \n",
    "necessary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* This problem feels related in spirit to the \n",
    "[**Collatz conjecture**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). That is, the \n",
    "repeated application of a simple algorithm to some numerical state 'must' arrive at some\n",
    "specified final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* By-hand calculations on some small example rings makes clear that\n",
    "there are no obvious counter-examples. The assertion seems credible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* $R_n$ may contain more than one negative value. This gives a choice of flip location. \n",
    "Since the assertion is *'$Q$ is inevitable'* the choice of flip site should be made inimically \n",
    "if possible in order to produce a counter-example. This might be a cycle where some number\n",
    "of flips leads from $R_n$ back to $R_n$; or it might be a sequence of rings that perpetually\n",
    "progresses by flips without ever arriving at $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observation: The definition of a *flip* suggests $n > 2$ but a trivial extension of the\n",
    "flip idea does permit $n = 2$ and $n = 1$. The latter can only be $Q$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observation: Any $R_n$ includes at least one positive number; and it can therefore \n",
    "be subjected to a reverse-flip procedure that generates a parent ring. A ring with \n",
    "$p$ positive values has $p$ parent rings. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observation: If we can produce a metric $M(R_n)$ and show it is strictly monotonic \n",
    "under repeated flips, and that it is bounded, and that it is not asymptotic...\n",
    "then we are pretty darn close to a solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Observation: There are two distances between sites on $R_n$: The number of hops\n",
    "between sites considered in the clockwise and then also the number of hops in \n",
    "the anti-clockwise direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The partial solution given below required some heuristic development\n",
    "via computer analysis.  To cut to the chase see ***Solution*** below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The narrative now continues with some 'conjectures' about these rings and flips.\n",
    "The conjectures are inspired by computer experiments and they assume the\n",
    "assertion 'Q is inevitable' is correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conjecture 1: Every $R_n$ reduces to one and only one $Q_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no way to configure a ring $R$ to have symmetry under rotation. This follows from\n",
    "the sum of values being equal to 1. If there were this conjecture would be false.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conjecture 2: $R \\rightarrow Q$ takes the same number of moves $q$ regardless of flip choices\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes the view that all possible ring configurations for fixed $n$ are found exactly once \n",
    "as a vertex in a rigid directed graph. The directed edges of this graph are flips. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualifier: A ring $R_n$ actually has $n$ permutations from rotating the ring \n",
    "say clockwise by 1, 2, 3, ..., n-1 sites or equivalently by changing where the\n",
    "indexing begins. All $n$ versions are *equivalent* and converge to equivalent \n",
    "versions of $Q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conjecture 3: $R \\rightarrow Q$ has a fixed total flip sum $f$ regardless of flip choices\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the flip sum $f$ as the sum of positive additions in each flip operation. Flipping -3 to 3 adds 6\n",
    "to the flip sum. Just as the number of required flips is fixed for any $R_n$ so is $f$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conjecture 4: Any $R_n$ can be reached through some sequence of inverse flips applied to $Q_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Again subject to the rotation qualifier given above. The $1$ \n",
    "in $Q_n$ must be in the proper location to reach $R_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conjecture 5: For $c$ equivalent to $c'$ via rotation: If  $c \\in C_{n, m}$ then $c' \\notin C_{n, m}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $Q$ is taken through $m$ inverse-flips. Doing this multiple times will produce \n",
    "a set $C_{n, m}$ of all possible $R_n$ that are $m$ moves from $Q$.\n",
    "Then some $c \\; \\in \\; C$ can be rotated to an equivalent $c'$. $c'$ can then be \n",
    "flipped $m$ times to arrive at $Q'$ which will be $Q$ rotated \n",
    "by the same amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program notes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first program flips $R$ along a single path to arrive at $Q$. It can do so by random\n",
    "choice or by other means; and it includes a variety of possible metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second program uses recursion to follow all possible forward paths from $R$. \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "The third program begins from some $Q_n$ and uses reverse-flips to generate the \n",
    "complete directed graph to some depth in child-to-parent fashion.\n",
    "This gives the number of configurations at a *depth* distance (number of \n",
    "flips) from $Q$ which of course depends upon $n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice finding a good $M$ proves difficult. Metrics tend to be  \n",
    "trend-wise but not strictly monotonic; there is 'noise'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variant idea\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative\n",
    "value could be chosen from the ring and some double increment added to it, say $2e$ whereupon $e$ \n",
    "would then be subtracted\n",
    "from both neighbors to keep the sum constant. Even more generally: $e$ (finite positive)\n",
    "might vary from one move to another. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### further notes\n",
    "\n",
    "* RK makes the point that $F$ is a discrete $\\nabla^2$\n",
    "* 'How far around the ring must I traverse from some negative site to find a compensatory positive balance?' \n",
    "* An interesting thing happens (resembling a CA) when only one negative value remains in $R_n$.\n",
    "Suppose for example the ring is as shown below where $n\\;=\\;20$. \n",
    "There is only one number available to flip: producing a shifted 7  -7 pair;\n",
    "and then again to shift another step and so on: A traveling wave \n",
    "that propagates to the right around the ring. As the numerical values \n",
    "found in the ring do not change during propagation this suggests that\n",
    "any metric (if it is to be monotonic) should somehow incorporate a type of 'ring distance'. \n",

    "#### The progression to a partial solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Early attempts at this problem produced a number of metrics, all of which produced erratic and non-monotonic\n",
    "curves. These eventually tended to converge but there was no 'smoking gun metric'. It was clear that arbitrary\n",
    "rings were hard to analyze; so simpler rings with two or three non-zero values were introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code was refined a bit to look more carefully at ring behavior under flips. \n",
    "The second and third programs to do exhaustive recursive searches forward and backward respectively\n",
    "gave further clues. In particular it became clear that while ring flips could be chosen from among\n",
    "negative sites, nevertheless the initial ring was a vertex in a very rigid directed graph of all \n",
    "rings. This di-graph clearly has multiple paths to a particular ring, some intrinsic degeneracy. \n",
    "In a path graph the number of edges departing some $R$ equals the number of negative numbers \n",
    "found in $R$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In passing it became apparent that the $n$ equivalent versions of $Q$ would correspond to $n$\n",
    "permutations of any ring $R$ under rotation of indices.\n",
    "The reverse-flip graph originating from $Q$ generates all possible $R_n$ (with perhaps a\n",
    "rotation of indices needed). In contrast the exhaustive graph of all possible forward-flips \n",
    "on some initial $R$ produce only a small subset of those \n",
    "rings en route to $Q$. It would be interesting to visualize this with NetworkX.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A key useful idea was to look at the sum of flips in the path from $R$ to $Q$. This applied to \n",
    "simple rings (particularly binaries) finally provided enough information to guess a workable \n",
    "metric; particularly because the flip sum $f$ appeared to be constant regardless of flip site\n",
    "choices. This guess is the basis for the partial solution to the problem given below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For n $n=3$ ring it is easy to guess $f(R)$: It is twice the absolute value of the sum \n",
    "of neighbor-products. That is, suppose a 3-site ring has values $a$, $b$ and $c$. Then \n",
    "$f\\;=\\;2 \\left| {ab+bc+ca} \\right|$. At a given depth in the tree the \n",
    "value of $f$ varies from one $R$ to another; so the constancy of $f$ is related to \n",
    "ring configuration more than 'number of flips to $Q$'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That said it would be nice\n",
    "to revisit depth $q$ as a value to calculate directly from $R$. The candidate \n",
    "function is $\\frac{2f}{b}$ for binaries so extending this might be one path to\n",
    "completing the partial solution given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integer space idea \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see a ring as a series of $n-1$ integers with arbitrary sum followed by a final \n",
    "integer chosen to give the ring a total sum of $1$. This is an $n-1$-dimensional space of integers\n",
    "where we can look for extremal values of a metric defined on that space. This idea is related to the \n",
    "notion that for a fixed $n$ the set of possible ring paths is a directed graph. \n",

    "***In what follows we show there is a good monotonic-under-flips scalar function $M$ that behaves like\n",
    "a potential when applied to rings. However in order to show that this metric solves the original \n",
    "problem we need to also establish that it is bounded; which is still an open question.***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a ring $R_n$ of $n$ integers with sum $1$ my aim is to show that under repeated flips of \n",
    "negative values (as described above) $R_n$ will invariably be transformed into a quiescent state $Q$ \n",
    "where no further flips are possible. I introduce a metric $M(R_n)$ suggested by empirical trials\n",
    "and show that a flip on $R_n$ produces a new ring $R'_n$ where $M(R'_n) \\; < \\; M(R_n)$. \n",

    "Note if a distance about the ring is $s$ then the negative of the distance in the other direction is $s-n$.\n",

    "two elements of the ring are as far apart as possible. Each term\n",

    "This metric yields $f$, the sum of all flip values during the (inevitable)\n",
