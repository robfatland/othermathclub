## Egon is stumbling home in bluing and rags


Egon is a painter and a central character in this chapter.
It must be said of Egon that while he does not have a great deal of initiative,
he does have the admirable quality of perseverence. Once he gets an idea in his head 
he will keep pursuing it, for much longer than most people. Also Egon has a friend named 
Kdppi; whose name is unpronounceable. She is quite the opposite
of Egon: She has a wealth of ideas and initiative but she always seems rather busy,
particularly doing her homework... so she can come across as a little bit impatient. 


One evening Egon was stumbling home (he is rather uncoordinated, more so in the later phases
of theevening) when he passed by a restaurant. Really it is a pub; but they serve curry and rice. 
In the pub there is a television, and the television shouts at Egon as he walks by:  
'... Something Something Something Binomial Theorem Something Something!!'
Egon perseveres, continues walking, arrives home and falls asleep.


The next morning he meets Kdppi for coffee. She seems to be working on a homework problem
that involves writing rows of zeros across a piece of paper. 'A television shouted
"Binomial Theorem" at me last night", observes Egon. "Do you have any notion of what 
that means?"


"Certainly!" responded Kdppi. She writes down on a fresh sheet of paper $( \alpha \; + \; \beta ) ^ {n}$.


Egon stares at it for a few moments. "What is this $\alpha you have here?"


"Oh that's the beauty of it: $\alpha$ can be anything!"


Egon stared for a few more moments. "And $\beta$? I suppose $\beta$ can be anything?"


"Of course!" responded Kdppi. "Now you're getting the hang of it!"


Egon made a 'nonplussed' face and doggedly continued: 'And is $n$ anything as well?' 


'Oh no' she replied. $n$ is a non-negative integer. 


'What is that?' asked Egon.


'Well $n$ can be zero or one or two or three or four or... and so on like that, as high as you care to go.'


'So anything, anything, and then $n$ is 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Isn't this supposed to be *equal* to
something?'


'If you like.'


'Well so what is it equal to?' asked Egon. 


Kid Pipkin finished writing another row of zeroes -- this time there were a few ones as well -- before responding.
'Well suppose $n$ is 2. Then you have $\alpha$ plus $\beta$ squared, which is $\alpha^2$ plus $2 \cdot \alpha \cdot \beta$
plus $\beta^2$.'


'But where did the $\alpha$ go in the $\beta^2$?'


'Oh it's still there; but it is raised to the zero power... so it is just 1 and we do not bother writing that down.'


'Ah', said Egon, starting to get the idea, then really the complete version looks like so:...' and he wrote down: 


$$
(\alpha + \beta)^2 = 1 \cdot \alpha^2 \cdot \beta^0 + 2 \cdot \alpha \cdot \beta + 1 \cdot \alpha^0 \cdot \beta^2
$$


'Yes, just so,' said Kid Pipkin. 'But the result will change if you modify $n$ from 2 to something else.'
