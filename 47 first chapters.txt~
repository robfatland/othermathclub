## Chapter 1 version 1

'Oh no!' Claire looked aghast at the slowly spreading ink stains on her jeans
pocket. Out came the pen, uncapped, much too late to stem the inky tide, out
came a disembodied pen cap, and then it was tears welling.

'Well... at least you're not racist.' This came from Caleb, across the aisle
of the bus. Caleb had an incredible ability to be inappropriate. He was the
world's genius of saying the stupidest possible thing. Claire's face
transformed into a mask of scorn. Then contempt. Then what she felt was a
pretty good version of disgust. And then she looked away and felt again the
horror at the ruined pants. Somewhere in the back of her thoughts came a
phrase that had stuck with her. She was not sure if it applied to her or to
the idiot Caleb; but it blared out for a moment in her brain. 'Rapid-cycling
psychotic'. And with that she resigned herself to staring out the bus window,
eyes defocused, as the blurs of the city flew backwards past.


## Chapter 1 version 2

'Suppose you go fishing...'

Mr. Lent was clearly on the ramp up the roller coaster. Claire generally began
to feel queasy.

'So your friend drops you off with your fishing pole and your plan is to take
the bus home.'

His voice was gathering momentum. There was no other way to describe it.

'And you fish for a while but you don't catch anything and it is time to catch
the bus home, see? And your fishing pole is five feet long. But it is old and
brittle and doesn't bend. So the bus comes, right? So you start to get on when
the bus driver says 'Hold on there!' He says you can't get on board the bus
with anything bigger than three feet in any dimension.'

Claire began to wonder where this was going in spite of herself. But at the
word 'dimension' she realized this would never do... she had gone quite far
enough thank you... and so effortlessly she summoned the Great Distractor and
lapsed into a state of complete Awareness. Mr. Lent vanished. The class vanished. The desk: Gone. All
that remained was the hair tie on her wrist as she quietly twisted it and
tried to remember today's lunch menu. Pizza I think? The remainder of the
roller coaster receded as a distant rumble of wheels on tracks.

## Chapter 1 version 3

'Did you feed... no, I'm sorry, I mean: *Thank you* for feeding the dog.'

'Oh shoot!' (only it wasn't 'shoot') as she stood up and rushed towards the
refrigerator.

'You know you don't need to say that. 'Shoot' will do just as well.'

'You say it.' 

'Yes; and you may say it as well; but only... only when...'

But she was already clattering down the stairs to feed the dog.
