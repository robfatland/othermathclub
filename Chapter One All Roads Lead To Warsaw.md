## Egon is stumbling home in bluing and rags


Egon is a painter and a central character. His full name is Egon Byzkn.
It must be said of Egon that while he does not have a great deal of initiative,
he does have an extraordinary ability to persevere. Once he gets an idea in his head 
he will keep pursuing it, for much longer than most people. Egon has a friend named 
Kyd; whose last name is Pypkn. She is rather the opposite
of Egon in some ways: She has a wealth of ideas and initiative but 
she tends to seem rather busy,
particularly busy with her homework... to be honest she can come across as a little impatient.


Most mornings around 9:30 or so Egon and Kyd have coffee in the piazza, the public square 
at the center of the town where they live, a town called Monte Carlo. 


One evening Egon is stumbling home (he is rather uncoordinated, more so in the later stages
of the evening) when he passes a restaurant. Really it is a pub; but they serve curry with 
rice. In this pub there is a television, and the television shouts at Egon as he walks by:  
'... Something Something Something Binomial Theorem Something Something!!'
Egon ignores this, perseveres, continues walking, arrives home and falls asleep.


The next morning Egon meets Kyd for coffee in the piazza. She seems to be working on a 
homework problem that involves writing rows of zeros across a piece of paper. Egon clears
his throat.

'A television shouted "Binomial Theorem" at me last night", observes Egon. "Do you have any notion of what 
that means?"


"Certainly!" responded Kyd. She writes down on a fresh sheet of paper ${( \alpha \; + \; \beta )}^n$.


Egon stares at this for a few moments. "What is this $\alpha you have here?"


"Oh that's the beauty of the binomial theorem: $\alpha$ can be anything you like."


Egon stared for a few more moments. "And $\beta$? I suppose $\beta$ can be anything?"


"Of course!" responded Kdppi. "Now you're getting the hang of it!"


Egon made a 'nonplussed' face and doggedly continued: 'And is $n$ anything as well?' 


'Oh no' she replied. $n$ is a non-negative integer. 


'What is that?' asked Egon.


'Well $n$ can be zero or one or two or three or four or... and so on like that, as high as you care to go.'


'So anything, anything, and then $n$ is 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Isn't this supposed to be *equal* to
something?'


'If you like.'


'Well so what is it equal to?' asked Egon. 


Kid Pipkin finished writing another row of zeroes -- this time there were a few ones as well -- before responding.
'Well suppose $n$ is 2. Then you have $\alpha$ plus $\beta$ squared, which is $\alpha^2$ plus $2 \cdot \alpha \cdot \beta$
plus $\beta^2$.'


'But where did the $\alpha$ go in the $\beta^2$?'


'Oh it's still there; but it is raised to the zero power... so it is just 1 and we do not bother writing that down.'


'Ah', said Egon, starting to get the idea, then really the complete version looks like so:...' and he wrote down: 


$$
(\alpha + \beta)^2 = 1 \cdot \alpha^2 \cdot \beta^0 + 2 \cdot \alpha \cdot \beta + 1 \cdot \alpha^0 \cdot \beta^2
$$


'Yes, just so,' said Kid Pipkin. 'But the result will change if you modify $n$ from 2 to something else.'
