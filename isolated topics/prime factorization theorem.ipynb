    "# **Prime Factorization Theorem** \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> All positive integers > 1 can be factored into a **unique** set of prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We prove this by contradiction: We assume the theorem is *false* and then arrive at a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If certain numbers can be factored as primes in at least two different ways then there is a smallest such number $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first factorization of $N$ will be the product of some primes designated $\\alpha$ (with subscripts). The second \n",
    "factorization will be written in terms of some $\\beta$ prime factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the $\\alpha$ set and the $\\beta$ set have common elements then they can be canceled out to produce a *smaller*\n",
    "number with two different factorizations. But $N$ is the smallest. So the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ factor sets share\n",
    "no common elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That's enough of a set-up. Now we follow through some arithmetic to arrive at a contradiction.\n",
    "On the way we find new numbers less than $N$; and since $N$ is the smallest number with two unique prime \n",
    "factorizations these smaller numbers can have only one prime factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N = \\alpha_{0} \\; \\cdot \\; \\alpha_{1} \\; \\cdot \\; \\alpha_{2} \\; ... \\; \\alpha_{j} = \\alpha_{0}\\; \\cdot \\; A$$\n",
    "$$N = \\beta_{0} \\; \\cdot \\; \\beta_{1} \\; \\cdot \\; \\beta_{2} \\; ... \\; \\beta_{k} = \\beta_{0}\\; \\cdot \\; B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where we have already said that\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lbrace \\alpha \\rbrace \\;\\;\\; \\bigcap \\;\\;\\; \\lbrace \\beta \\rbrace = \\emptyset\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$N$ can't be even for if it *was* it would have $2$ as a factor and $2$ would show up in both \n",
    "the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ sets. (*Odd* times *odd* is *odd*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $N,\\;\\; \\lbrace \\alpha \\rbrace, \\;\\; \\lbrace \\beta \\rbrace, \\;\\; A$ \n",
    "and $B$ are all odd.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume $\\;\\alpha_{0} < \\beta_{0}$. (If not: Swap the $\\alpha$'s and $\\beta$'s.)\n",
    "Therefore $A > B$. Therefore for some $q > 0$ and some $r > 0$ we have $\\beta_{0} = \\alpha_{0} + 2q$ and $A = B + 2r$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is worth re-stating because it is crucial! There are positive integers $q$ and $r$ which account\n",
    "for the differences between $\\alpha_0$ and $\\beta_0$ and between $A$ and $B$. Those two differences\n",
    "are even numbers: Everything is odd and the difference between two odds is even. And so the differences\n",
    "(being even) contain a factor of $2$. In fact: $2\\cdot q$ and $2 \\cdot r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we continue:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N = \\alpha_{0} \\;\\cdot\\;A = \\alpha_{0}\\; \\cdot \\; (B + 2 \\cdot r) = \\beta_{0} \\; \\cdot \\; B = (\\alpha_{0} + 2 \\cdot q) \\; \\cdot \\; B$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Just focus on the third and fifth expressions in this equation sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha_{0} \\cdot B + \\alpha_{0} \\cdot 2 \\cdot r = \\alpha_{0} \\cdot B + 2 \\cdot q \\cdot B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can eliminate the $\\alpha_{0} \\cdot B$ term from each side and divide out a $2$ to arrive at\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r \\; \\cdot \\; \\alpha_{0} = q \\; \\cdot \\; B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these are less than $N$. Therefore there is only one way to factor both the left and the right\n",
    "sides of this equation: The prime factor sets are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As $r \\cdot \\alpha_{0}$ has but one prime factorization (it being less than $N$) \n",
    "and as $B$ does not include $\\alpha_{0}$ in its factors (it is the product of $\\beta$s): \n",
    "$q$ must be a multiple of $\\alpha_{0}$. We write\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\;\\;q = s \\cdot \\alpha_{0}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "for some number $s > 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall we began with $N = \\alpha_{0} \\cdot A = \\beta_{0} \\cdot B$ where $A$ and $B$ have no common factors. \n",
    "We chose the $\\alpha$'s and $\\beta$'s so that $A \\; < \\; B$ and this gives us the sequence: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\alpha_0 A = (\\alpha_0 + 2q)B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "substituting for $q$ from\n",
    "\n",

    "$$q = \\alpha_0 s$$\n",

    "\n",
    "to arrive at\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = (1+2s)B$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now $A < N$ means that there is but one prime factorization for $A$, one that apparently includes $B$, but $A$\n",
    "and $B$ share no common factors; so this is a contradiction. Our original assumption that some $N$ exists with\n",
