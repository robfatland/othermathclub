    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A ***PDF*** or Probability Distribution Function describes the probability of each possible outcome \n",
    "of an experiment. It applies to discrete situations; and it has a continuous-probability analog \n",
    "called a Probability Density Function (also a PDF). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If probabilities in a PDF are ordered in some way they can be summed in a cumulative manner\n",
    "to give \"the total probability to this point\". This is the Cumulative Distribution Function\n",
    "or ***CDF***. One of the most useful aspects of a CDF is that upon summing over all possible\n",
    "outcomes it should reach a value of $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a type of experiment I would like to introduce now that involves the repetition of \n",
    "random trials. As an example: How many times do we expect to throw a single dice for it to \n",
    "come up 3? We might roll the dice and get a 6, then a 5, then another 6, then a 3; so the \n",
    "outcome of this repetition process was 4 throws. Another experiment might only require 2 \n",
    "throws, another might take 15, and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's ask what the PDF looks like in this case. The outcome space is the space of positive\n",
    "integers. Why? Because there is some probability of finishing on the first throw. There is\n",
    "some probability of finishing on the second throw. This is less than the probability of \n",
    "finishing on the first throw because sometimes a second throw will be unnecessary: We threw\n",
    "a 3 on the first throw. There is some probability of finishing on the third throw. And\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin rolling our dice, we create a tally sheet of empty numbered boxes. \n",

    "\n",

    "Now with 20,000 trials the averaging process is simpler. Suppose tick box \"1\" has 3,419 \n",
    "tick marks. Rather than adding up \"1\" 3,419 times (as we did in Step One) we just multiply 1 x 3,419 to \n",

    "etcetera. If tick box 7 has 219 marks: Add 7 * 219 to the total. The tick boxes make the sum easier. \n",
    "At the end: Suppose the grand total is 121,432. Just as before divide by 20,000 to get the \n",
    "expectation, the expected number of rolls required to get a 3.\n",

    "like a long tail getting smaller as the tick box numbers get larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence of numbers is a probability distribution: It is more likely to take three rolls to get 3\n",
    "than it is to need 41 rolls. One thing distinguishes this numerical sequence from a PDF, however: \n",
    "If the values in the tally boxes are numbers like 3,419 and 2,753 and so on, they do not add up to one. \n",

    "\n",
    "A third time we set out to do this experiment. As before we set up tick boxes. As before we run\n",

    "and 1 representing experimental probabilities for rolling a 3 after so many rolls. \n",

This is a sum over the number of ways to finish the game on throw $t$.

    "Notice that the third case, P(D and W), comes out 1/12 just as above where C and S were independent of one another. This is interesting because there is (in both cases) a dependence built into the use of the word 'and'. That is, we have a subtle distinction between the nature of the events and whether they depend upon one another. In the first case with C and S independent, the outcome question \"Do C and S both happen?\" ties them together. In the second case \"Do D and W both happen\" also ties together two probabilities, but W is already tied to D by it's definition. The nature of the question we ask about the final outcome has built into it the nature of the constituent events.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's make an observation '''A''' and suppose that this is somehow (perhaps?) causally connected to a set of driving conditions <math>B = {B_i}</math>. Furthermore suppose that those conditions are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, hence MEX-EX (my term). The connection between A and B is not deterministic but rather probabilistic. For example A might be the temperature of an outdoor thermometer and the B's might be seasons. This situation is the set-up for both the theorem of Bayes and for a system of inferring information in a probabilistic setting called ''Bayesian Inference''. And Bayesian Inference is carried to a broader set of ideas called Bayesian Analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "First point: MEX-EX seems to be a (useful) analog to a pdf: The sum of <big><math>P(B_i)</math></big> must be 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Second point: There is an implicit model relating dependent probabilities that works in both directions. Or it should eventually become an explicit model, case by case. One of the important ideas here is that the model itself is up for grabs: It might be good, it might be lousy; and we try and let the data tell us which within the Bayesian framework.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This derives from the definition of the probability of both A and Bi occurring, written P(A, Bi). I won't bother formatting Bi to save time. Clearly P(A, Bi) = P(A|Bi) x P(Bi). The probability of the temperature being 5 deg C and it being winter is the probability of a 5 deg temperature when it is winter (estimated at 0.05) times the probability that it ''is'' winter (at an arbitrary date this is 0.25). So that gives me a probability of it being 5 deg C and winter as 1/80.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I will say, by the way, that both temperature and season are ''states'' of the system (the authors say 'of nature'); but they stick with the idea that A is an observation and {Bi} are the MEX-EX states. I arbitrarily state that in winter the temperature is between -9 and +10 each with equal probability; so that is how I got to 1/20. But do I believe that the chances that it is winter and 5 deg are 1/80? Let's do the same with two dice. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the chances of box cars? 1/36. P(6|6) = 1/6 and P(6) = 1/6 so that works for independent events. I think the idea is ok for now. So onward with a particular Bi:\n",

    "\n",
    "P(Bi, A) = P(A, Bi) is ok.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So P(Bi|A) = P(A|Bi)P(Bi)/P(A) is ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And then finally we say that the some of all conditional probabilities for A over the various B's is, in total, the probability of A since the B's are MEX-EX. That's only fair. So now that's Bayes' Theorem.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Inference follows: Your dependency model across all MEX-EX states is the characterization of reality that determines probabilities of independent states given your observation A. What is your model? It is a set of two probability distributions: P(A|Bi) and P(Bi) for all I."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider selecting 2 books from ***a*** books. The claim is that this should be\n",

    "\n",
    "There are ***a*** ways of selecting a first book. The ***a-1*** books remain on the shelf. So\n",
    "there are ***a-1*** ways of selecting a second book. The total number of ways of selecting\n",
    "both a first and a second book is therefore $a \\cdot (a-1)$. This is a sort of \n",
    "shortened version of ***a*** factorial. We can write this as the fraction \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{a!}{(a-2)!}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "This is good so far, but we have one additional detail to\n",

    "***a*** books on the shelf. This choice is one of the possible subsets\n",
    "among our $a \\cdot (a-1)$ possibilities for 2-book subsets. In this\n",
    "case suppose our first title is ***Through The Looking Glass*** and our second\n",
    "title is ***The Wind In The Willows***. We put these two books back on the shelf\n",
    "and do the selection a second time. That is, we select two books from\n",
    "the ***a*** books on the shelf again as a first and then a second selection.\n",
    "This time suppose that our first title is ***The Wind In The Willows*** and \n",
    "our second title is ***Through The Looking Glass***. This is the same\n",
    "subset as before, selected in a different *order*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The detail is: We do not have any order to the books in our subsets.\n",
    "This means that the above calculation $a \\cdot (a-1)$\n",
    "counting subsets will count a single subset as two separate subsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Subset { ***The Wind In The Willows***, ***Through The Looking Glass*** } is the \n",
    "same as subset { ***Through The Looking Glass***, ***The Wind In The Willows*** }.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All possible two-book subsets are double-counted when we use $a \\cdot (a-1)$. \n",
    "This is twice the correct result: \n",
    "$\\frac{a \\cdot (a-1)}{2}$, and that matches the combination result:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2-book \\; subsets \\; of \\; a \\; books \\; = \\; \\frac{a!}{2! \\cdot (a-2)!} \\; = \\; \\binom{a}{2} $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the same argument for three-book subsets from the shelf of ***a*** books. \n",
    "This time the calculation \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a \\cdot (a-1) \\cdot (a-2) \\; = \\; \\frac{a!}{(a-3)!}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "will over-count the number\n",
    "of subsets by a factor of six, which is $3!$. This means we introduce a $3!$ in \n",
    "the denominator to fix the over-counting and again the combination is correct. \n",
    "The conclusion is that combinations correctly count subsets by first \n",
    "compounding the number of ways they can be selected and then dividing out \n",
