    "A couple of chemistry problems\n",
    "Suppose we have to start doing chemistry problems and we are presented with:\n",
    "\n",
    "How many ml of 0.25M  are needed to deliver 0.00450 moles of  during a chemical reaction?\n",
    "Suppose you needed to prepare a 100ml solution of 1.05M NaOH using 1.5M NaOH, distilled water, and a 100ml graduated cylinder. How would you do this?\n",
    "Define four ideas\n",
    "A couple of observations to begin with: We need a good working definition of both moles and molarity. We also need a good agreement on how we derive the mass of an atom or molecule. And we need to know why they stipulated a graduated cylinder. So this is four questions that I will answer. After that I will come back and re-state the problems. I hope they will be more tractable by then.\n",
    "\n",
    "One mole of something is one Avogadro's number of it; which is approximately 6e23 particles. That is 6 times ten raised to the twenty-third power; which is rather a lot. More accurately 6.022 but I will just use 6. It is interesting to consider how much space a mole of Honda civics would take up if they filled a cube.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way in addition to massive particles we can also have a mole of massless particles. In particular -- pun intended -- a mole of photons (light particles) is called an Einstein of photons, as before 6e23 of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the question of mass does not really come into play in our two problems... or maybe just a little bit... nevertheless I think it is worth connecting these moles (particle counts) to masses. So time out while we do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mass of a bunch of identical particles\n",
    "I will take protons and neutrons to have a mass of one (1) and electrons as being massless, mass = zero (0). These are approximations. Furthermore for a given atom (fixed number of protons) there are variable numbers of neutrons possible. These atom variants are called isotopes. For example we hear plenty about  or Carbon-12 which has 6 protons + 6 neutrons... but there is a surprisingly large amount of C-13 in the world as well; and it is pretty stable. There is even C-14 but this tends to fall apart after a thousand years or so. But that is physics, not chemistry. Point is I'm going to just take the mass of Carbon to be 12, full stop. We see atomic masses on the periodic table with some extra digits like 12.003. I'm just going to round to the nearest integer. If we start working with mass spectrometers--whatever those are--then we can use those extra digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what are these proton units? Answer: They are called atomic mass units; where one proton has a mass of 1. This unit (I find) is now indicated by the letter u as in One Hydrogen atom has a mass of 1 u. Originally these were 'Daltons' and my chemistry friends still say Daltons so I will too. Daltons = atomic mass units (Da = u). We have not yet said what these are equivalent to in familiar units of mass. Let's do that next.\n",
    "\n",
    "We wish to connect moles to Daltons via kilograms. One Da is 1.66e-27kg. One mole of Hydrogen weighs less than one mole of carbon because moles are 'number of particles' and one Carbon is heavier than one Hydrogen. So moles do not translate to kilograms until you say moles of what. A mole of Hydrogen atoms -- each one weighing one Dalton -- weighs 6e23 (particles per mole) times 1 (Daltons per particle) times 1e-27 (kilograms per Dalton) = 0.001 kg. Informally we notice that .001 kg is one gram.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the joke question 'What weighs more: A pound of feathers or a pound of bricks?' Well now you know a different version that is sensible: 'What weighs more: A mole of feathers or a mole of bricks?'\n",
    "\n",
    "So... this is why Avogadro's number was chosen to be that goofy number 6.022e23: So that \"a mole of something equals its (Daltons) weight in grams\". Therefore: Every time we see a mole of something and it has a molecular formula we can tot up all the atoms in that formula by their mass in Daltons; then change the word Daltons to grams; and then loudly we shall proclaim \"this many grams of this stuff is one mole of it\". For example in problem 26 we see  which is one Potassium (K) at 39 Da, one Manganese at 55 Da, and 4 Oxygen each at 16 Da for a total of 158 Da. So 158 grams of  is one mole of it. Or six hundred thousand million million million molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Onward to cylinders (graduated) and molarity (concentration)\n",
    "I have answered two of the four questions: What is a mole and how do we deal with the masses of molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next let's dispense with the graduated cylinder. These do not have a lot of spare capacity above the top line so a 100ml graduated cyclinder can be taken to hold only 100ml of liquid, not more. Therefore any solution-building we do can't exceed 100ml in the \"bucket\" at any one time. Which reminds me of gallon puzzles so let me give you one of those to work out while I go make sure I have a good working definition of molarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have two beakers that are not graduated. Let's say they were held back by Professor Erlenmeyer. They just have one line on the neck with a label showing how much you have when you fill to the line. One holds precisely 900ml and the other holds 400ml. Using a spigot of water flowing into a sink in your chemistry lab: How would you obtain 300ml of water? Is there only one way?\n",

    "molarity\n",
    "I saved this one for last as the most important and the most difficult to comprehend. Molarity is moles per liter.\n",
    "\n",
    "molarity revisited\n",
    "Ok maybe I should expand that out a little bit. What I mean by molarity...\n",
    "\n",
    "Molarity is a measure of concentration. If you add salt and more salt and more salt to a glass of water you are increasing the concentration -- the molar concentration -- or the molarity -- of the salt in the water. Of course as you add salt you could tip out some of the solution to keep the volume of the solution constant. Since you are adding in pure salt and tipping out water-with-salt-dissolved the salt is winning and the concentration of salt is increasing. Let's restate this idea of concentration using more words. First take a deep breath; then read (aloud if possible) the following two paragraphs...\n",
    "\n",
    "Moles of something (say methane) per liters of something else (say kerosene) is molar concentration, also called molarity. Moles of sodium hydroxide per liter of water is another measure of molarity. Moles per liter is abbreviated with a capital M. Sometimes molar concentration is abbreviated as mol/l or the more confusing molL-1 which unpacks as moles = mol and liters = L and 'raised to the -1' means you put it in the denominator so you get moles divided by liters. So ten moles of some solute -- some thing -- in 20 liters of some solvent -- some liquidy thing -- would be 0.5 molar concentration or 0.5 moles per liter or 0.5mol/l or 0.5molL-1 or 0.5M.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the molarity of water dissolved in water? This is an Alice question but let's try it out. We have one liter of water which is 10 x 10 x 10 centimeters. One cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram. One liter of water weighs 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 grams. One molecule of water weighs 18 Daltons. One mole of water weighs 18 grams. So 1000 grams of water contains 1000 / 18 = 55.555 moles of water. Rounding up: Water is about 56 moles per liter. We dissolved this water \"in itself\" I suppose... there's nothing wrong with doing so but it seems odd that the solute and the solvent are the same thing. Usually in chemistry class the solute is not the solvent; so only a smarty-pants would proclaim 'Guess what! The concentration of water is 56 moles per liter!'... and then Professor Erlenmeyer says 'Sit down Ms Granger.'\n",

    "Problem 26 Solution\n",
    "How many ml of 0.25M  are needed to deliver 0.00450 moles of  during a chemical reaction?\n",
    "Spoiler alert: This could be wrong... but there is a better than 50% chance that it is right, in my estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call the answer X milliliters and notice the difference between the answer they want (X in milliliters) and the definition of molarity (moles per liter) that we work with. This we can address with unitary analysis: Keeping all the units in play to make sure the answer we get is in the units we want. In particular we introduce the ratio of liters to milliliters as (1 / 1000) (liters / milliliter).\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way: Since we are working with moles and volumes we never actually need to calculate the mass of the  in grams; so we do not need Daltons or grams. This is a convenient aspect of working with moles like me.\n",

    "This in English is \"X-many milliliters of concentration 0.25 moles per liter equals .0045 moles; and don't forget to convert from liters to milliliters.\" Notice that the molarity M I have written as moles / liter. The word 'liter' in the denominator cancels the word 'liter' in the numerator of the (1/1000) fraction. The 'milliliters' also cancel leaving just moles. That is: On the left side the only units that don't cancel out are moles and that is also what we have on the right side. This means that our units balance out.\n",

    "First we notice we are starting with a concentration of 1.5M NaOH and ending with a concentration of 1.05M. This is good news because it means we are simply going to dilute the original solution. How much of it do we pour into the graduated cyclinder before topping it off with distilled water? Let's call that amount Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to place the Y ml of 1.5M NaOH on the left side of an equation and multiply by the molar concentration to arrive at a number of moles. On the right I also calculate how many moles we would have of NaOH if we have a volume of 100 ml (I use 1/10 liter) and a molar concentration of 1.05 mol / liter:\n",
    "\n",
    "Y ml x (1/1000) (liters/ml) x 1.5 moles / liter = (1/10) liters x 1.05 (mol / liter)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again we have the units canceling leaving moles = moles; so that's good. In fact it is essential. Then the numbers give us Y = 70 ml. This makes sense because we are going from a concentration of 1.5M to 1.05M which is a bit more than two-thirds; and 70 is a bit more than 2/3 of 100, the volume of the graduated cylinder.\n",

    "\n",
    "If I pour in the NaOH first and then add water the sodium ions will stay on the bottom perhaps not mixing very well. If I do it in the other order maybe the sodium ions will mix into the water as they sink. That's really just a guess. The  ions I don't think have any trouble mixing in.\n",

    "What is an electron?\n",
    "Four answers... first for impatient people, then some historical narrative, then an art-based narrative, and then finally back to the answer for impatient people.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those impatient for a working understanding\n",
    "Look around you: Light falls into your eyes and your brain interprets the pattern as a representation of objects or matter. What is this matter? A computer, a chair, maybe some lunch? Back in 1680 or so with Isaac Newton poking around we (the human race) began to get very methodical and systematic about asking 'What is this matter made of really?' The natural course of inquiry was to try and break things down into smaller and smaller pieces; and then ask 'if I understand the pieces do I understand the whole chunk of matter?' This question occupied the intellectual curiosity and stubborn persistence of the human race: From then until now; where a large portion of the puzzles was figured out by the 1920s. This section summarizes the results: Very approximately.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pick up a book and a styrofoam box you notice a difference in mass and volume. Those are basic properties of objects. When you let go of the book it falls to the floor; so we say 'there is a force called gravity that operates between objects with mass.' So far so good. Is this everything we need to understand laws of force? No. We need to add another item to our short list of properties of matter: Charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a comb through someone's hair a bunch of times and hold the comb up to a balloon there is some stickiness going on apparently not related to gravity. This demonstrates a property of some matter -- but not all matter -- called charge. Also sometimes called electrical charge; so you can see the word electron sneaking in here.\n",
    "\n",
    "At very small scales matter is made of aggregates of atoms called molecules. Atoms are the building blocks. They in turn are assembled from three smaller building blocks: Protons, neutrons and electrons. The neutrons do not have an electrical charge; the electrons and the protons do. All three have mass. And now here is the curious thing: The mass of the electron is about 1/1836 the mass of the proton; but the charge of the electron is equal to the charge of the proton except that it is of opposite sign. By convention we say the electron has charge -1 and the proton has charge +1. The rule of charge-based force is: Opposite charges attract and like charges repel. So electrons and protons are drawn together.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no good reason I know of why electrons are so light in comparison to protons and yet have precisely the same magnitude of charge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the implication of a force of attraction based on electrical charges, where opposites attract. Perhaps when an electron is near a proton they just collapse together to form a neutron that has a total charge of zero. This is a great idea but it does not work out in practice. This paragraph exists to tell you that some of the rules of how things work on the scale of electrons and protons are very different from the rules of how things work on the scale of you and me. There is not much we can do about this; but the rules for small things are quite interesting and fun to learn about so on balance I think it is a win for us that they are different. Anyway one of the small things rules says that electrons and protons will stick together by electrical force of attraction but only so close to one another and no closer. As a result we have a model of atoms where protons gather together in the nucleus or center of the atom creating a point of positive charge and electrons gather about this center (but not at the center) as smears or clouds of negative charge. When seen from a distance an atom with the same number of electrons as protons appears to have no charge: It is electrically neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this picture complete we need to add neutrons -- recall they have no charge -- that are also bound up in the nucleus of the atom with the protons. Neutrons have no charge and weigh about the same as protons, maybe 1% heavier. You might reasonably ask: If there are a bunch of protons stuck together at the center of the atom... and they all have positive charge... and like charges repel or push one another away... and if the neutrons are there also but have no charge to speak of... then doesn't this repelling force cause the nucleus to disintegrate or even fly apart?? It is a good question because, yes, protons do push one another away. But atoms do not disintegrate and this is due to another one of the small things rules. This new rule states that there is yet another force called the nuclear force that is much stronger than the electrical force and it pulls the positively charged protons and the un-charged neutrons together. The nuclear force binds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of the atom. This makes the atom stable and we are now arriving at our model of how atoms work in chemistry. There is one more idea needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final idea concerns the electrons that are not (by the first rule of small things) permitted to exist inside the nucleus of the atom. Like the protons (with positive charge) the electrons (with negative charge) tend to push one another away. The electrons exist as little smears or clouds of negative charge that are attempting to be close to the positively charged nucleus by attraction but far from one another by repulsion at the same time. This leads to some very interesting mathematics where we can derive the shapes of the electron clouds. These electron cloud shapes are given the rather unfortunate (because it is misleading) name atomic orbitals. For the moment I will stick with the descriptive language: Electrons exist in differently shaped cloudy smears around the nucleus of the atom. The cloud smears stick out in different directions. In summary we have negative charge electron cloud smears and positive charge protons in the nucleus. These charges interact to create a kind of lumpy bumpy atomic charge geometry; and as one lumpy bumpy charge smear atom happens to pass near another one: They might just stick together. This creates a very complicated world of atomic interactions that on our large human being scale we call chemistry. So chemistry is in a sense the connection between the world of small things and the world of large things; and it depends entirely upon the finer details of how negatively charged electrons interact between atoms.\n",

    "# More Electrons\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A second look at 'what are electrons?'\n",
    "The story of electrons is closely bound up with the story of light. Let us return therefore to Isaac Newton's thoughts on the nature of light, around the year 1660. He noticed that a traditional telescope magnifies by bending light through glass lenses; and this caused a problem because the different colors of light would each bend differently. This creates little rainbows around white dots of light (say like stars) as in the image below. This blurriness could use a descriptive name; and since the rainbow-smears are not what we want we can say \"It is a mess.\" And since color is involved we can say \"In fact it is a color mess.\" However people are not happy with short simple terms like this so instead they say \"It is a chromatic aberration.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "drawing\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton noticed that reflected light bounced the same no matter its color... the reflection angle did not change from red to yellow to green to cyan to blue. So... he went to some pains to invent and build a new type of telescope from curved mirrors rather than lenses. Today such telescopes are called Newtonian reflector telescopes. This little parenthesis is to emphasize two things: First that Newton saw the question of how light works as a challenge, and second that he was prepared to take on that challenge in every way he could imagine. He persevered by devious plans and schemes to better understand light. He thought about what it means to polish glass, for example, and he carried out a famous experiment on sunlight using prisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now before going further with Sir Isaac: What is the plan here? The plan is to tell three stories spanning from 1670 to 1905. The first concerns Isaac Newton's disagreements with certain people on the nature of light. He did an experiment with prisms and suggested using the word spectrum for the rainbows this produces. The idea of a spectrum leads into the second story, about how spectrums differ one from another; and what can one figure out from careful observation of spectra? (Which do you prefer: spectrums or spectra?) Part two arrives at the predictive nature of good science: 'If my understanding is correct then it must be true that...'\n",
    "\n",
    "The third story jumps to 1905 to connect electrons and light once more. It involves a fellow employed in the city of Bern in Switzerland as a patent office clerk. His job was to evaluate new inventions... did they deserve a patent? But in his spare time he was able to indulge his curiosity on the nature of light and electricity. Since Newton's time he had the benefit of 250 years of additional thought, observation and experiment to build upon. So those will be the three stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part One: Prism sentences\n",
    "Newton put some very opaque curtains at his window blocking the light; except where he put a little prism. On a sunny day this prism would break the light of the sun into a rainbow of color on the far wall of his room. This he called a spectrum. Now sunlight is white whereas the spectrum cast upon the wall was red and orange and yellow and green and cyan and blue and violet. How to explain this?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well prisms and rainbows were well known; so there were already two ideas about the nature of light popular at this time. Notice the word popular: Does this not imply that science is a parade of fads and fashions? Yes! Absolutely true, but with one little asterisk at the end, perhaps like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Science is a progression of fads and fashions; of opinions, biases, beliefs, even prejudices*.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so what about this asterisk? There must be the accompanying asterisk at the bottom of the page, and just what is written after that? Well in 1660 (independent of Newton) a group of people in London decided to form a club with the motto Nullius in verba which is Latin for \"Don't take anyone's word for it.\" The purpose of the club was to start explaining how things worked; and their motto was important as a milestone in the shift to repeatable demonstration as the basis for belief in a particular explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*but remember: Nullius in verba!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok so what were these two related fashionable ideas about light? First white is a color. And second light is a phenomenon of waves. Newton through his experiments arrived at different conclusions: That light is composed of particles (corpuscles he said) and that white light is in fact a superposition of our familiar colors and not a color itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very nice demonstration of Newton's experiments with prisms here. I highly recommend it; it runs about five minutes. It includes a good example of how to not over-simplify when it discusses recombining a spectrum into white light.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to miss a small point here: In Newton's experiment can you still explain the results using the old idea that 'white light is a color'? Certainly you can but Newton's explanation has the advantage of being simple and self-consistent. Similarly his conclusion that light is made of particles led to further ongoing debate. The history is fun to read but to conclude our first story let's imprint in our memory this image of Newton as a young man (in his twenties) setting up a prism to cast a solar spectrum on the wall of his darkened dormitory room.\n"

    "\n",

Meanwhile a little bee who can fly very quickly flies back and forth between the two trains along the track. She flies at 150 miles per hour. She begins this back-and-forth flight path just as the two trains start off. Now the two trains will eventually collide but happily they are automated trains with nobody on board so nobody gets hurt.

    "### Friendly introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few more logic problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### More knights and knaves\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Smullyan has given us problems about Knights and Knaves. Knights always tell the truth. Knaves always lie.\n",
    "The quality of being a knight or a knave is a person's *type*. \n",
    "These interesting people live on an island that you happen to be visiting. As you are walking along the road you \n",
    "happen upon two residents A and B who make the following statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A: B is a knave.\n",
    "B: I am a knight. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Are A and B of the same type? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The word 'if' comes in handy; or you may prefer the word 'suppose'... \n",
    "\n",
    "A is either a knight or a knave. Suppose A is a knight. Then B is indeed a \n",
    "knave; which means that he would be lying when he speaks. B claims to be a knight so in this case everything\n",
    "is consistent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose A is a knave.   Then B must be a knight since A is lying. B claims to be a knight which is also \n",
    "consistent. Conclusion: A can be either a knight or a knave but B must be of the opposite type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the two statements contradict one another. When this happens (on this island) we know one speaker\n",
    "is a knave and the other a knight. We continue with more selections from Professor Smullyan's\n",

    "\n",
    "Certain students have asked for challenging problems involving logic. \n",
    "Here are a few I'm aware of... \n",
    "\n",
    "### The *perfect logician* premise\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems often involve persons participating. I use the term *mathematician* to indicate someone\n",
    "who is instantly able to reach correct logical conclusions from information given to them. This person\n",
    "is sometimes called a *perfect logician*. This premise allows you to avoid thinking about trick answers.\n",
    "These problems are about application of logic, not finding trick answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Two numbers and two mathematicians\n",
    "\n",
    "Two mathematicians $S$ and $P$ are told that integers $x$ and $y$ have been chosen such that \n",
    "$1 < x < y$ and $x+y < 100$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$S$ is given the value $x+y$.\n",
    "$P$ is given the value $xy$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They have the following conversation (all true statements):\n",
    "\n",
    "**P**:  I cannot determine the two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**S**:  I knew that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**P**:  Oh really? Well now I know what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**S**:  Oh really? Well now so do I.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are $x$ and $y$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conway's Wizards\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem is similar to the one above.\n",

    "\n",
    "A: “I have a positive integral number of children, whose ages are positive integers, \n",
    "the sum of which is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.” \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B: “How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, \n",

    "## Prisoners and hats\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem concerns prisoners who must determine the color of hats placed on their heads that they\n",
    "can not see. The hats are red or black. While each prisoner is unable to see the color of his or her \n",
    "own hat some prisoners can see the hats of other prisoners. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prisoners are not allowed to speak except to declare the color of the hat on their head. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The important point is that the prisoner may say 'my hat is red' or 'my hat is black' but they must otherwise \n",
    "remain silent. In some cases a prisoner is forbidden from speaking at all regardless of what they know. \n",
    "This is explained further below. If a prisoner correctly identifies their hat color all of the prisoners\n",
    "are released. We are not interested in guessing here; only in cases where prisoners can be certain of \n",
    "their hat color.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a particular prisoner-hat problem using three (or four) numbers: $(p, b, r \\left[,q\\right])$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p$ is the number of prisoners\n",
    "  - they are placed in a line of chairs facing to the left\n",
    "  - they are numbered $1, 2, 3, \\dots, p$ from left to right\n",
    "  - as they face to to the left: $2$ can see the hat of $1$ but not of $3$. $3$ can see the hats of $1$ and $2$, and so on\n",
    "  - ...therefore prisoner $p$ can see the other $p-1$ prisoners' hats\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $b$ is the number of *black* hats in the hat bin\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $r$ is the number of *red* hats in the hat bin\n",
    "  - hats are placed on prisoner's heads from the bin\n",
    "  - some hats may be left over and not placed on anyone's head\n",
    "  - all of the prisoners know how many hats of each color are in the bin\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- $q$ is optional: The number of prisoners starting at the far right who may not speak\n",
    "  - prisoners who do not speak may realize their own hat color but everyone knows they are prevented from speaking\n",
    "  - if a number is not given for $q$ then $q=0$ and anyone may speak\n",
    "\n",
    "Now a problem can be phrased 'Given a particular (p, b, r, q) will the prisoners go free?' \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (1, 1, 0) the prisoner immediately says 'my hat is black' since there is only one (black) hat. He goes free.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (1, 1, 0, 1) the prisoner may not speak, alas. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (1, 1, 1) the prisoner's hat is either black or red so he has no way of being certain. He can only guess but\n",
    "this is not allowed, alas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (2, 1, 1) we have two prisoners. Prisoner 1 sees nothing and is silent. Prisoner 2 sees a hat of one color (red or black)\n",
    "and immediately says he is wearing a hat of the opposite color (black or red) since there are only two hats. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (2, 2, 0) either prisoner can announce that he is wearing a black hat. Remember that they both know how many\n",
    "hats there are of each color in the hat bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we make the problems more complicated. Problems are solvable by the prisoners only if they are \n",
    "solvable for any and every possible sequence of hats. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about (3, 2, 1)? This is easily solved by $3$. What about (3, 2, 2) where one hat is left over? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(5, 3, 2) is easily solved by prisoner $5$... but what about (5,3,2,1)? In this case prisoner $5$ may not speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Is (6, 10, 1) solvable? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you set yourself some additional problems and solve them you may start to develop an idea of which\n",
    "hat problems are solvable. \n",
    "The abstract and difficult problem here is actually this: If you have $p$ prisoners and $b=p$ black hats: \n",
    "What is the largest number of red hats you can have such that the problem is still solvable?  If you\n",
    "solve this problem then all prisoner-hat problems become instantly decideable. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Eye color problem as given by Randall Munroe, paraphrased\n",
    "\n",
    "A certain fellow named Randall Munroe has carefully presented the problem given below. \n",
    "I have done a little paraphrasing; he gets 100% of the credit for popularizing this problem.\n",
    "I transcribe the problem here to decouple it from other web content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island.*\n",
    "*No one knows the color of their own eyes.* \n",
    "*Anyone can see the eye color of another person.*\n",
    "*Every night at midnight a ferry stops at the island.*\n",
    "*Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes must leave the island on the ferry, and the rest stay.*\n",
    "*Everyone can see everyone else at all times.*\n",
    "*Everyone keeps a count of the number of people they see with each possible eye color (excluding themselves).*\n",
    "*Noone may communicate with someone else in any way concerning eye color.* \n",
    "*Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru.*\n",
    "*The Guru happens to have green eyes.* \n",
    "*So any blue-eyed person sees 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green).*\n",
    "*This does not tell that person his or her own eye color.*\n",
    "*As far as he or she knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue.*\n",
    "*Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he/she could have red eyes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Guru is allowed to speak once, let's say at noon on one day in all their endless years on the island.*\n",
    "*Standing before the islanders she says:*\n",
    "\n",
    "***\"I can see someone who has blue eyes.\"***\n",
    "\n",
    "*Question: Who leaves the island, and when?*\n",
    "\n",
    "*There are no mirrors or other tricks. The answer is based on logic.*\n",
    "*The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular.*\n",
    "*She is simply saying \"I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island who isn't me.\"*\n",
    "*The answer is not \"no one leaves.\"*\n",

    "What other types of numbers do we know about that we could use to work on this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you have guessed it!  We need to solve this problem on the complex plane. So now I will invite you to imagine an\n",
    "extended metaphor called the Dance Party. Imagine you have entered a vast ballroom. On the\n",
    "floor near the center is painted a dot, the origin. At a distance of one hopskip from that dot is drawn a circle. \n",

    "Now what happens? A girl comes into the room. She is carrying a guitar and wearing roller skates. She is wearing a \n",
    "t-shirt upon which is written the expression $x^2+1$. She begins singing and playing the guitar. Both the singing and\n",
    "the guitar are at a medium volume level as she stands in one location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You walk over and start pushing her around the dance floor. She does not seem to mind but you notice that as \n",
    "you move her the volume of both the guitar and the singing change. Furthermore sometimes the music is in a \n",
    "major key and sometimes in a minor key. Finally you notice that whenever you roll her to some point on the \n",
    "Real axis she stops playing the guitar entirely. It falls silent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is going on here?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The girl wearing the function t-shirt is a representation of that function. She is only one place at a time -- which\n",
    "we refer to as $x$ -- but she can \n",
    "be relocated to any other point on the complex plane; which would be a different $x$. \n",
    "Wherever she is on the dance floor can be represented as a complex number\n",
    "$x=(a, b)$. The number $a$ is the real coordinate of $x$. The number $b$ is the imaginary coordinate of $x$. \n",
    "Notice that both $a$ and $b$ are themselves real numbers. \n",
    "That is: The complex number $x$ is simply a pair of real numbers $a$ and $b$ written\n",
    "as $(a, b)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at any given location (complex number) the function can be calculated. But this function of a complex number\n",
    "is itself also a complex number that we will write $(s, g)$. The value of $s$ is represented by how loud the girl\n",
    "is singing. The value of $g$ is how loud she is playing the guitar. Since both $s$ and $g$ are real numbers they\n",
    "may be either positive or negative. When $s$ is positive she sings in a major key. When $s$ is negative she sings\n",
    "in a minor key; and likewise with the guitar. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have imagined a way of representing a complex-valued function on the complex plane. We can send this particular\n",
    "girl out to switch t-shirts to one of the other functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when the girl crosses the real axis her guitar falls silent. Let's discuss why this happens. If the \n",
    "guitar falls silent that means that the imaginary part of the function is zero. Suppose you push the girl onto \n",
    "the real axis somewhere and then begin pushing her along the real axis. At each location she calculates $x^2+1$.\n",
    "On the real axis the imaginary coordinate is zero; so the number looks like $(a, 0)$. When you square this \n",
    "number you will get $(a^2, 0)$ which is also a real number with zero imaginary part. Since the guitar volume\n",
    "is the imaginary number, and since that is zero, the guitar is silent. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have discovered a set of locations (the real axis) where the imaginary part of the function is zero. \n",
    "However what we are interested in is where the function goes entirely to zero, which is $(0, 0)$. That is, \n",
    "when we have the equation $x^2+1=0$ we are saying 'the function $x^2 + 1$ falls to zero *somewhere*; and\n",
    "where is that? Where does the girl stop playing the guitar *and* stop singing?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that the girl stops playing the guitar on the real axis: Perhaps we should look carefully along the\n",
    "real axis to see if there are some places where she also stops singing. Then we will have some solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it would be a good idea to review what zero means. In real numbers zero is just $0$. It is the origin. \n",
    "For complex numbers -- which are two real numbers -- zero is just what you would expect: $(0, 0)$. So for our\n",
    "function $x^2+1$ to reach a value of zero both the real part and the imaginary part must be zero. We have already\n",
    "shown that $x$ cannot be on the real axis because any real number squared plus one is greater than zero. Therefore\n",
    "we must search off of the real axis for good values of $x$. Such good values when squared and added to $1$ are equal\n",
    "to zero. Therefore when they are squared they must equal $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So in other words there is a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part that you can square to get $-1$. Then\n",
    "you add $1$ and you arrive at zero = $0$ = $(0, 0)$ = (no singing, no guitar). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you know that $x = i$ works; but let's write that in terms of coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = i = (0, 1) = e^{\\;i \\frac{\\pi}{2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we have jumped into the Distance-Angle representation \n",
    "of complex numbers. In fact we have four differen ways to write\n",
    "a complex number...\n",
    "\n",
    "- as a point on a diagram\n",

    "\n",
    "The last representation has distance $r$ and angle $\\theta$ where \n",
    "the angle is measured in radians. This is the distance around the\n",
    "unit circle so 180 *degrees* is $\\pi$ radians. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The great advantage of using distance+angle to represent complex \n",
    "numbers is that they are very easy to multiply. If you wish to\n",
    "multiply two complex numbers you arrive at a third complex number\n",
    "as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$re^{i\\theta} \\cdot se^{i\\gamma} = r\\cdot s \\cdot e^{i(\\theta+\\gamma)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is you multiply the two distances and you add the two angles\n",
    "to arrive at the product of the two complex numbers. Let's use this\n",
    "rule to square a complex number since we are thinking about the\n",
    "function $x^2+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(re^{i\\theta})^2=r\\cdot r \\cdot e^{i(\\theta+\\theta)}=r^2e^{i 2 \\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember we are looking for where the guitar and the singing \n",
    "both fall silent; and that happens where $x^2$ is equal to negative\n",
    "one. Therefore let's set $x^2$ equal to $-1$... but let's write both\n",
    "of them in distance-angle notation also.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r^2\\cdot e^{i 2 \\theta} = 1\\cdot e^{i\\pi}$$\n",
    "\n",

    "you multiply by another factor of $3/4$; and this never stops. You keep cutting smaller and \n",

    "\n",

    "$$x^2+1=0$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Notice that if $x$ is a real number then $x^2$ is a positive number unless $x=0$. If $x=0$ then $x^2=0$. So in both\n",
    "cases when we add $1$ to this we will not get to zero. That is, $x^2+1$ is *never* zero if we use real numbers. \n",
    "What other types of numbers do we know about that we could use to work on this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you have guessed it!  We need to solve this problem on the complex plane. So now I will invite you to imagine an\n",
    "extended metaphor called the Dance Party. Imagine you have entered a vast ballroom. On the\n",
    "floor near the center is painted a dot, the origin. At a distance of one hopskip from that dot is drawn a circle. \n",
    "(A hopskip is about 5 yards.) Since this is a radius of one it is of course a unit circle. \n",
    "And then lastly at right angles through the dot are drawn two lines which are the real and the imaginary\n",
    "coordinate axes, $\\Re$ and $\\Im$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what happens? A girl comes into the room. She is carrying a guitar and wearing roller skates. She is wearing a \n",
    "t-shirt upon which is written the expression $x^2+1$. She begins singing and playing the guitar. Both the singing and\n",
    "the guitar are at a medium volume level as she stands in one location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You walk over and start pushing her around the dance floor. She does not seem to mind but you notice that as \n",
    "you move her the volume of both the guitar and the singing change. Furthermore sometimes the music is in a \n",
    "major key and sometimes in a minor key. Finally you notice that whenever you roll her to some point on the \n",
    "Real axis she stops playing the guitar entirely. It falls silent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is going on here?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The girl wearing the function t-shirt is a representation of that function. She is only one place at a time -- which\n",
    "we refer to as $x$ -- but she can \n",
    "be relocated to any other point on the complex plane; which would be a different $x$. \n",
    "Wherever she is on the dance floor can be represented as a complex number\n",
    "$x=(a, b)$. The number $a$ is the real coordinate of $x$. The number $b$ is the imaginary coordinate of $x$. \n",
    "Notice that both $a$ and $b$ are themselves real numbers. \n",
    "That is: The complex number $x$ is simply a pair of real numbers $a$ and $b$ written\n",
    "as $(a, b)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at any given location (complex number) the function can be calculated. But this function of a complex number\n",
    "is itself also a complex number that we will write $(s, g)$. The value of $s$ is represented by how loud the girl\n",
    "is singing. The value of $g$ is how loud she is playing the guitar. Since both $s$ and $g$ are real numbers they\n",
    "may be either positive or negative. When $s$ is positive she sings in a major key. When $s$ is negative she sings\n",
    "in a minor key; and likewise with the guitar. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have imagined a way of representing a complex-valued function on the complex plane. We can send this particular\n",
    "girl out to switch t-shirts to one of the other functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when the girl crosses the real axis her guitar falls silent. Let's discuss why this happens. If the \n",
    "guitar falls silent that means that the imaginary part of the function is zero. Suppose you push the girl onto \n",
    "the real axis somewhere and then begin pushing her along the real axis. At each location she calculates $x^2+1$.\n",
    "On the real axis the imaginary coordinate is zero; so the number looks like $(a, 0)$. When you square this \n",
    "number you will get $(a^2, 0)$ which is also a real number with zero imaginary part. Since the guitar volume\n",
    "is the imaginary number, and since that is zero, the guitar is silent. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have discovered a set of locations (the real axis) where the imaginary part of the function is zero. \n",
    "However what we are interested in is where the function goes entirely to zero, which is $(0, 0)$. That is, \n",
    "when we have the equation $x^2+1=0$ we are saying 'the function $x^2 + 1$ falls to zero *somewhere*; and\n",
    "where is that? Where does the girl stop playing the guitar *and* stop singing?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that the girl stops playing the guitar on the real axis: Perhaps we should look carefully along the\n",
    "real axis to see if there are some places where she also stops singing. Then we will have some solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it would be a good idea to review what zero means. In real numbers zero is just $0$. It is the origin. \n",
    "For complex numbers -- which are two real numbers -- zero is just what you would expect: $(0, 0)$. So for our\n",
    "function $x^2+1$ to reach a value of zero both the real part and the imaginary part must be zero. We have already\n",
    "shown that $x$ cannot be on the real axis because any real number squared plus one is greater than zero. Therefore\n",
    "we must search off of the real axis for good values of $x$. Such good values when squared and added to $1$ are equal\n",
    "to zero. Therefore when they are squared they must equal $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So in other words there is a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part that you can square to get $-1$. Then\n",
    "you add $1$ and you arrive at zero = $0$ = $(0, 0)$ = (no singing, no guitar). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you know that $x = i$ works; but let's write that in terms of coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = i = (0, 1) = e^{\\;i \\frac{\\pi}{2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we have jumped into the Distance-Angle representation \n",
    "of complex numbers. In fact we have four differen ways to write\n",
    "a complex number...\n",
    "\n",
    "- as a point on a diagram\n",
    "- as two coordinates $(a, b)$\n",
    "- as the same two coordinates with an $i$: $a + ib$\n",
    "- as a distance and an angle $re^{\\;i\\theta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last representation has distance $r$ and angle $\\theta$ where \n",
    "the angle is measured in radians. This is the distance around the\n",
    "unit circle so 180 *degrees* is $\\pi$ radians. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The great advantage of using distance+angle to represent complex \n",
    "numbers is that they are very easy to multiply. If you wish to\n",
    "multiply two complex numbers you arrive at a third complex number\n",
    "as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$re^{i\\theta} \\cdot se^{i\\gamma} = r\\cdot s \\cdot e^{i(\\theta+\\gamma)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is you multiply the two distances and you add the two angles\n",
    "to arrive at the product of the two complex numbers. Let's use this\n",
    "rule to square a complex number since we are thinking about the\n",
    "function $x^2+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(re^{i\\theta})^2=r\\cdot r \\cdot e^{i(\\theta+\\theta)}=r^2e^{i 2 \\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember we are looking for where the guitar and the singing \n",
    "both fall silent; and that happens where $x^2$ is equal to negative\n",
    "one. Therefore let's set $x^2$ equal to $-1$... but let's write both\n",
    "of them in distance-angle notation also.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r^2\\cdot e^{i 2 \\theta} = 1\\cdot e^{i\\pi}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So this means that $r^2=1$ and $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. So we have\n",

    "you ask yourself not 'How much void area is gone?' but rather 'How much colored-in area remains?' you \n",

    "Suppose you start with the entire triangle colored in; and suppose it has area $1$ square unit. Now remove \n",

    "the next step in the iterative void-cutting process where you have the three large remaining colored \n",
    "triangles and you remove the center sub-triangle from each of those. How much space remains? Well it \n",
    "is going to be $3/4$ of the remainder\n",
    "you had before, after the first step, because you just removed $1/4$ of that remainder. \n",
    "So it is $3/4$ of $3/4$ or $9/16$ remaining area. \n",
    "Repeat the process again and how much remains? $3/4$ of $9/16$. In fact at each successive step\n",
    "you multiply by another factor of $3/4$; and this never stops. You keep cutting smaller and \n",
    "smaller voids out of the remaining triangles forever. So the question is 'What is $3/4$ raised\n",
    "to the infinity power?' And the answer is of course zero. No colored-in area remains. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Claim**: A positive integer $n$ is unknown. Its square\n",

    "\n",
    "To be honest this claim seems wobbly... let's see what happens when I try to prove it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We know $n^2$ is even. This means that $2$ is one of the \n",

    "and there are no other primes involved. Writing in this way expresses the abstract\n",
    "nature of $n$ (we don't know how many prime factors it has) together with the definite\n",
    "nature of $n$ (it is *most definitely* prime or the product of primes).\n",

    "$n$ appear in the prime factorization of $n^2$. Since $2$ is one of those prime\n",

    "**A number $n$ is prime if and only if $n$ divides evenly into $(n-1)! + 1$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $n$ divides evenly into $(n-1)!+1$. Then $n$ must be a prime because if $n$ was not\n",
    "a prime we would have an impossible situation. $n$ would be the product of at least two\n",
    "numbers less than $n$ and greater than $1$. Let's say these are $a$ and $b$ and it does not\n",
    "matter if they are prime or not. Both $a$ and $b$ appear in the list of factors of \n",
    "$(n-1)!$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(n-1)! \\;=\\;1\\;\\cdot\\;2\\;\\cdot\\;3\\;\\cdot\\;4\\;\\cdot\\;\\dots\\;\\cdot\\;a\\;\\cdot\\;\\dots\\;\\cdot\\;b\n",
    "\\;\\cdot\\;\\dots\\;\\cdot\\;(n-3)\\;\\cdot\\;(n-2)\\;\\cdot\\;(n-1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both $a$ and $b$ divide evenly into this number (they are factors of it) they do not divide into this number\n",
    "plus one. This is easy to see by example: $5$ divides into $20$ and therefore does not divide into $21$. So to repeat:\n",
    "$a$ and $b$ do not divide into $(n-1)!+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is the problem, first by example: If $2$ and $3$ multiplied together make $6$ then any number divisible\n",
    "by $6$ is also divisible by $2$ and $3$. In our proof: If the number $n$ divides into $(n-1)!+1$ and $n$ \n",
    "is the product of $a$ and $b$ then both $a$ and $b$ must divide into $(n-1)!+1$ as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize our last two conclusions: If $n$ is not prime then \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $a$ and $b$ *do* divide into $(n-1)!+1$\n",
    "- $a$ and $b$ *do not* divide into $(n-1)!+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is impossible. Therefore $n$ is not composite. Therefore $n$ is a prime. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In short\n",
    "if $n$ divides into $(n-1)!+1$ then $n$ is prime because a factor of $n$ must but cannot divide into $(n-1)!+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the first part of the\n",
    "proof, that *if* $n$ divides into $(n-1)!+1$ then $n$ is prime. The next part is more difficult: We still need\n",
    "to show that $n$ **must** divide into $(n-1)!+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is only one even prime ($2$) let us agree that $2$ divides into $(2-1)!+1=2$. Only the odd primes\n",
    "remain. We could keep working examples ($3$ divides into $2!+1$, $5 divides into $4!+1$ and so on... but this \n",
    "is a losing game knowing as we do that the number of primes is infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "So taking $n$ to be an odd prime: Does $n$ divide evenly into $(n-1)!+1$ every time? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Working through an example \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the odd prime $13$. Rather than show that it divides evenly into $12!+1$ (which it does) let's \n",
    "take a moment to look at all the numbers from $1$ to $12$ (since $12 = 13 - 1$). I will list pairs of numbers\n",

    "\n",
    "That shows that each member of the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 12} matches with another (in two cases the same)\n",
    "to product a product congruent to $1$ *modulo* $13$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we switch to abstract terms. $13$ becomes some prime $p$. Some number in the set \n",
    "$\\{ 1, ..., (p-1) \\}$ becomes $x$. Then $xy \\equiv 1(mod\\;p)$ is the congruence we are\n",
    "discussing. The claim is that there is only one way to do all the matchings of $x$ to $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here we go. Let's consider all possible pairings $y$ as products for some $x$ in the $\\{ 1, ..., (p-1) \\}$ set:\n",
    "$P=\\{ x, 2x, 3x, ..., (p-1)x \\}$. This new set $P$ is the product set for $x$ where $x$ is paired with other numbers \n",
    "of the $\\{ 1, ..., (p-1) \\}$ set including somewhere in there the product $x^2$ for when $y$ happens to equal $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose two of these numbers in this set of products are congruent mod p; say for different elements $r$ and $s$. \n",
    "Then $rx\\equiv sx(mod\\;p)$ and so $(r-s)x\\equiv 0(mod\\;p)$. This means that $p$ divides into $(r-s)x$ with no\n",
    "remainder; so $p$ must divide into $(r-s)$ or $x$ since $p$ is prime. However $(r-s$) is not zero and $x$ is\n",
    "not zero and so both $(r-s)$ and $x$ are too small for $p$ to divide into them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since none of the members of $P$ are congruent to any others modulo $p$ each must have its own modulus. \n",
    "Furthermore none of them is divisible by $p$ so their mod $p$ value may not be zero. There are, fortunately,\n",
    "exactly $(p-1)$ possible remainders and $(p-1)$ elements in $P$ so these must match up. One of them has\n",
    "a modulus (remainder) of $1$ for the chosen value of $x$. This is a unique matching for that remainder. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We noted above that $x$ might be matched with itself. Considering that possibility that $x^2\\equiv 1(mod\\;p)$\n",
    "we see that $p$ divides evenly into $x^2-1$ so both $x=1$ and $x=(p-1)$ will work. The other values of $x$\n",
    "will not partner $x$ with itself to achieve congruence to $1$ mod $p$. There is an even number of $x$ values\n",
    "remaining so every number both *can* and *must* have a matching number to give $xy \\equiv 1(mod\\;p)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficult step is next. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If $a\\equiv 1(mod\\;p)$ and $b\\equiv 2(mod\\;p)$ then $a$ and $b$ are both multiples of $p$ plus $1$. \n",
    "Written this way they can be multipled; giving various cross terms that are multiples of $p$ plus that\n",
    "$1 \\times 1 = 1$ term at the end. So their product is *also* congruent to $1$ modulo $p$. So numbering\n",
    "the $x$ and $y$ matches as $1, 2, ..., (p-1)$ we have\n",

    "\n",
    "$$x_1y_1\\equiv x_2y_2 \\equiv \\cdots \\equiv 1(mod\\;p)$$\n",

    "## Four Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "Four identical bugs A, B, C and D are placed on the corners of a square table one meter on a side. \n",
    "A faces B who faces C who faces D who faces A. Each bug immediately begins walking towards the bug it faces.\n",
    "How far does each walk before they converge at the center of the table?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional: Picture the two diagonals of the table. Do the bugs' paths cross over these diagonals? If so: How many times? \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional: Suppose there are an arbitrary number of bugs $n$ placed at the vertices of a regular polygon. They begin walking towards the next bug along the perimeter. How far do these bugs travel before they meet in the center? For this generalization of the problem let's standardize the side of the polygon to have length $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "As each bug walks towards the next on the perimeter of the square the four \n",
    "bugs will spiral inwards and meet at the center of the square arena. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each bug travels 1 meter\n",
    "* Each bug does cross the diagonals of the original square as they spiral in to the center.\n",
    "* The number of diagonals each bug crosses is unbounded (<math>\\infty</math>).\n",
    "\n",
    "This revisits Zeno's paradox: Each bug finds itself stepping over the diagonals an \n",
    "infinite number of times on a finite walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an argument that the third result (infinite diagonal crossings) follows from the second:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A$ faces and begins walking towards $B$ on the original table top; where $B$'s starting location coincides \n",
    "with a diagonal of the square. Call this the pending diagonal of $A$ since $A$ walks in that direction. \n",
    "Suppose $A$ crosses over the pending diagonal; but not at the center.  At this moment all four bugs are \n",
    "crossing their respective pending diagonals. The shape of their arrangement is still a square. \n",
    "Hence the original problem has been scaled down to a smaller version of itself: The bugs occupy the four corners \n",
    "of a smaller square concentric with the original square.  Each bug has traveled through 90 degrees as seen \n",
    "from the center of the square. Each bug has a new pending diagonal. This transformation will repeat, \n",
    "each time with the bugs moving closer to the center. Since the bug paths are mathematically ideal\n",
    "the bugs will cross the diagonals an infinite number of time while traveling a finite distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More on the infinities\n",
    "\n",
    "As the bugs continue to spiral inward the infinite succession of pending diagonals become infinitely close together, what a relief: Both the travel time and the distance to the center are finite. If we unravel that path into a straight line and mark the locations of the diagonals that are crossed in succession, we will have no problem fitting an infinite number of such locations on our finite line segment which, after all, includes an infinite set of points from which to choose.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Solution by plausible argument: The four bug locations $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are always arranged in a perfect square where the side of the square reduces in length from 1 meter at the start to zero at the center. Furthermore at any instantaneous moment in time each bug is walking precisely along the edge of that square. If I am bug $A$ then every step I take moves me that much closer to bug $B$. Since bug $B$ is traveling at right angles to my direction of travel: Bug $B$'s motion does not increase nor does it decrease my distance to bug $B$. That is: Even though my path is curving I am always reducing my distance to $B$ by the steps I take. Since I began one meter from bug $B$ I must walk 1 meter to meet her. Therefore 1 meter is the total distance traveled by each bug. $\\boxdot$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symmetry note\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem features a square that shrinks in size but remains a square. If you imagine being one of the four pursuers/pursuees and starting off on your journey you can see yourself making even just a very little headway as your path begins to curve inwards. At this point you and your three friend bugs are still at the vertices of a square. You are still facing along the edges of that square. And so you are starting the problem over on a slightly smaller square. \n",
    "\n",
    "From this we can infer one or two additional things: The spiral pathway itself must also scale downwards. That is, you could rescale it and rotate it and it would fit on top of itself. Furthermore if you have traveled through some angle $\\theta$ with respect to the center of the square, you can expect to have another angle $\\theta$ to go before you reach... the corner of a new smaller square. And from there yet again, and again, and again. In other words the spiral pathway passes through an unbounded number of diagonals of the original square, or if you like an infinite number of degrees of angle. (cf Zeno's paradox) \n",
    "\n",
    "The symmetry of the problem makes it easy to solve, both by direct argument and by some other methods that use more machinery as presented for example on this page. The machinery is unnecessary but it does connect our spiral pursuit path to both $\\pi$ and the base of the natural logarithm $e$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below the original square has shrunk. Upon taking the\n",
    "next step of size $\\delta$ the square shrinks yet again to size $S$. \n",
    "Each step in shrinking has been of length $\\delta$ followed by a rotation in heading through an angle $\\alpha$. \n",
    "\n",
    "import kilroy\n",
    "kilroy.Show('bugs', 'bug_pursuit_delta_step_diagram.png', 400, 400)\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that at the start the upper left corner bug has heading Zero. After some steps, should she reach the next diagonal,  her new facing will be downward, $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's restate the problem using its inherent symmetry: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Does each bug starting on an original diagonal of the square reach the next diagonal in its direction of pursuit?\n",
    "* If so, how far did it travel to get there?\n",
    "* If so, what is its radial distance from the center of the square on this next diagonal?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the answer to the first question is *yes* then the problem has simply been rotated by 90 degrees and shrunk and can be solved using an infinite series built from the answers to the second and third questions. That's the plan. We can\n",
    "number the $\\alpha$ angles in sequence $\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, ...$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the following equation holds then bug $A$ does reach the next diagonal, what we are hoping for.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3 + \\cdots$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A note on time\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the (constant) velocity of the pursuit does not matter, let's set it equal to one so that time and distance are related by equality. Hence distance traveled $d$ is equal to time elapsed $t$. This removes time and velocity from the problem since they don't have any impact on the answer anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A note on radial distance\n",
    "\n",
    "The original square of side length $S$ puts the pursuers at radial distance $R=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}S$ from the center of the square. Each step of length $\\delta$ brings the pursuer a distance $dr=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\delta$ closer to the origin (simple geometric argument based on the square of pursuit). After the pursuer has traveled a distance $d$ it therefore has a radial distance from the center of $r=R-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}d=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(S-d)$. The ratio of current radial distance to original radial distance (the closing ratio) would then be $\\frac{S-d}{S}$. Now let's just calculate that value of $d_D$ for a cumulative change in heading of $\\pi/2$ radians, when our pursuer crosses over that next diagonal.   \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sin \\alpha = \\frac{\\delta}{s} \\approx \\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the reasoning in the **Solutions_1#2 Four pursuers|arm-waving solution** immediately gives the answer to the problem since when $d = S$ we get back $s = S - d = 0$ which is the point at which the square has no side length and we have hit the center. Flogging the problem by calculus anyway nets us the contraction factor through a path around 360 degrees (say) as well as emphasizing the ''overcoming-Zeno'' facet.\n",

    "#### More Pursuit\n",
    "\n",
    "What if there are 3 cars? Or 2? Or 1 or Zero?! Or 5, or 6, or 19, or an infinite number? The solution is reasonably simple and I give it as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "$\n",
    "\\beta \\; = \\; \\pi \\; \\; (1 - \\frac{2}{n})\n",
    "$\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "prior to meeting all the other vertices at the center of the polygon. \n",

    "s \\; = \\; a \\; \\left( \\frac{1}{1+ \\cos \\left( \\pi\\; \\cdot \\; \\left( 1-\\frac{2}{n} \\right) \\right) } \\right)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "I take an infinite number of infinitesimals frame of mind to this problem. So the problem breaks down into \"What happens during an individual tiny step?\" and then \"How do all the steps sum up?\" The individual step is always in a straight line towards where the target was at the beginning of the step; and then after the step is done the car pivots a little bit in preparation for the next tiny step. \n",

    "Does the pivot action cost me any distance? Well if my steps become small enough then my pivots will also be very small; but again there are a huge number of pivots. But it does not sound like a pivot involves covering ground; so I will say from the outset that the little pivots do not contributte to the sum of my total distance travelled. This simplifies the tiny step part of the problem. I will also point out that after each car's step-and-then-pivot: The figure has the same shape as before with slightly smaller dimensions; so the geometric shape does not change as the various cars or points converge.\n",

    "Suppose I take a step $dx$. How much closer or further away am I from my target? When my target is headed away from me... provided he did not go as far in the radial distance ($dx$) as I did: I ought to be closer. So far so good because he goes $dx$ but not directly away from me. If there are only two cars in fact we are $2\\cdot dx$ closer. If there are three cars then he went towards the third car and moved in towards me a bit of his own volition; so I get more than $dx$ closer. For the square, with four cars, he went at right angles to my direction of travel so I am $dx$ closer. And if we have five or more cars then he is traveling around a pentagon / hexagon / etcetera obliquely away from me; so I do not make $dx$ worth of progress towards him. \n",

    "This is the key idea towards getting the solution for $n$ cars. My distance along the line of sight to him in one step is $dx$. If I subtract from this his distance traveled away from me as projected on the radial line from me to him I arrive at a closure distance per step. I can then take our initial distance apart, $a$, and divide it by this closure distance. That gives me the number of steps it takes to cover that initial distance $a$. And for each of these steps I actually moved $dx$. So I multiply number-of-steps times $dx$ and that is the answer.\n",

For larger values of $n$ we must go further and further, as the target is moving obliquely away in pursuit of his target; and so the solution given above seems quite reasonable. \n",

    "### Eye Color Problem Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Book 1 Chapter 13 provides a challenging logic problem, courtesy of Randall Munroe, about an island of people who\n",
    "do not know the color of their own eyes. Adam has bravely dived into this problem; we present here the outline of \n",
    "a solution that touches on the notion of proof by induction: Start out with a pattern that can build upon itself\n",
    "and notice the strange but logically consistent end-results. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes on the Eye Color problem \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will approach this problem by taking a common tactic: We will try and solve an obvious and much simpler\n",
    "problem first. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that instead of 201 people on the island there are only three people: One with blue eyes, one with brown\n",
    "eyes, and the guru with green eyes. What happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us modify the problem in the direction we want to go. Suppose there are\n",
    "five people on the island: One guru (with green eyes), two people with \n",
    "blue eyes and two people with brown eyes: What happens? Think about these two\n",
    "cases before reading further. See if you can arrive\n",
    "at a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Three people solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The guru sees someone with blue eyes. The person with blue eyes realizes 'oh... the other people\n",
    "do not have blue eyes; it must be me!' and they get on the boat that very night. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Five people solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now two people have blue eyes. Five total: So add in the guru and two people with brown eyes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us call the two islanders with blue eyes A and B. They are both present when the Guru says 'I see a person with\n",
    "blue eyes.' Now up to this point A could not say to B 'You have blue eyes' because this is not allowed. But the Guru \n",
    "simply said something that both A and B know is true, that there is someone on the island with blue eyes.  Although\n",
    "notice: They only know that the other person has blue eyes; they still do not know their own eye color. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now A reasons as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'If I have blue eyes then I must leave on the boat at midnight. But B has blue eyes so the Guru could have been \n",
    "referring to B, not to me. Therefore I do not know my own eye color for sure. Therefore I will not leave on the \n",
    "boat tonight.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B reasons exactly the same way; and both A and B wake up the next morning, having slept the night through still\n",
    "unsure of their eye color. They see one another... neither has left the island. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now A, upon waking up and seeing that B did not leave last night, reasons further as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'The only way that B could still be here is if I have blue eyes. For if I did *not* have blue eyes then B would \n",
    "have two pieces of information that would force him to leave on the boat last night: He could see that nobody else \n",
    "on the island had blue eyes simply by looking around; and he knew yesterday that there was at least one person on \n",
    "the island with blue eyes. Since the only person on the island whose eye color he does not know is his own: He would\n",
    "conclude that he must have blue eyes. Therefore he would have left on the boat last night, according to the rules. \n",
    "But he did not leave on the boat. Therefore he must not have been sure that he had blue eyes last night. Therefore \n",
    "there is at least one other person on the island with blue eyes. The only person that this could be is me because I \n",
    "can see that nobody else on the island has blue eyes. Therefore I have blue eyes. Therefore tonight\n",
    "(since I now know my eye color is blue) I must get on the boat and leave.' \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next morning both A and B are gone. Both reached the same conclusion and left on the boat. So in this case: \n",
    "After two days two people have left the island: Both of them being the people with blue eyes. Did you come up \n",
    "with a solution that agrees?  A very important question at this point is: Does it matter if instead of two \n",
    "people with brown eyes there are three? Or nine? Or 23?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have solved the case of five people on the island let's increase the number to seven! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seven people problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the island there is one green-eyed guru plus three people with brown eyes and three people with blue eyes. \n",
    "Same question: Who leaves, and when? You might try following a similar line of reasoning as above and see how \n",
    "it turns out. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seven people solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call the people with blue eyes A, B, and C. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first day, when the Guru says 'I see a person with blue eyes' there is some careful thought. Again we \n",
    "imagine what A would say to himself:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'Of course there is a person with blue eyes. B and C both have blue eyes. Regardless of my eye color (which might\n",
    "be blue) the island has two people for sure with blue eyes. Of course neither one of them can be sure of their own\n",
    "eye color. I know for example that when there are two people on the island with blue eyes they both leave after \n",
    "two days because on the first day they are not sure of their own eye color. I will predict that \n",
    "both B and C will still be here in the morning; but on the second day they will both be gone.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first night passes and A wakes up. Sure enough: B and C are both still there. The day passes and everyone \n",
    "goes to sleep in the evening. On the second morning A wakes up and is surprised to see that B and C are both still \n",
    "there. They did not leave on the boat! A now reasons as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'The only way B and C would be gone this morning is if they both saw only one other person on the island with \n",
    "blue eyes.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is: If only B and C had blue eyes it would just be the previous problem where there were five people on the island, \n",
    "two with blue eyes, where those two leave after two days. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A continues his thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'I was expecting B and C to leave on the second day. It occurs to me now that this was based on the assumption that\n",
    "my eyes are not blue. The only way they could have stayed the second night is if they were in the same situation as \n",
    "me: They both saw two other people with blue eyes. That is: Just as I saw two other people with blue eyes, so did \n",
    "B and C. That could happen only if I also have blue eyes. Therefore I have blue eyes... time to leave.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So reasons A; and B; and C. On the third morning: A, B and C were all three of them gone from the island. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the number of brown-eyed or green-eyed people does not matter. What matters is only the number of blue-eyed \n",
    "people. The island could have 1000 people with only two of them blue-eyed: And both of those people would be gone two days\n",
    "after the guru makes her comment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The original problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you convince yourself that on an island with four people with blue eyes: All four leave on the fourth day? \n",
    "If there are 100 blue-eyed people on the island then is it really true that all 100 of them leave on\n",
    "the boat 100 days after the guru makes her comment about seeing a person with blue eyes? It seems rather absurd \n",
    "when you look at it from this 'end result' point of view: People sitting around for days and days and weeks and\n",
    "months and then suddenly voom! Everyone with blue eyes gets on the boat!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rational or irrational: The square root of two\n",

    "From the **numbers** track (number theory)...\n",

    "\n",
    "or \n",

    "So again since $2c^2$ is even $b^2$ must also be even. Therefore $b$ is even. Therefore $a$ and $b$ (both being even) are not relatively prime. \n",

    "explore both history and topics in more depth, are beautifully written.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The book is also inspired by the National Research Council book _How People Learn_ which indicates that without a context web it is well nigh impossible to build an understanding of a subject. To put this another way: Some students, a small fraction, have the innate quality of initiative. They build context webs under their own power and they can sail through books by Martin Gardner having the time of their life. This book will -- I hope -- serve them some interesting material for that process; but this book is written for the person who might like the *idea* of being a mathematician but who has no idea how to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to provide a practical anecdote from my own experience. This has happened to me many many times: I read through a book on mathematics, I find a particular problem, and I set to work. The problem involves perhaps a myriad of possible solutions and I begin following up a particular idea. This turns into some algebra and suddenly I am expanding infinite sums of polynomials simply writing out line after line of symbols like an automaton; only to run aground on the shores of the Mare Insolvus. (need the proper Latin here; ask David Beck) (this sea goes on the map) Then I sit back and realize that the original author posed the problem precisely because there is an Aha solution… so I finally allow myself to relax and think about that. And within a few minutes the solution appears. This happened for the Gardner problem concerning the worm going through the 3 x 3 x 3 cube. I could tell the problem could be represented as a path through a graph but I became caught up in drawing the \n",
    "graph which prevented me from noticing the key idea that the worm alternates between edges and (faces or corners). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the middle school level: In 7th or 8th grade students are taught to work through 'algebraic equations' following the \n",
    "order of operations and the distributive principle and so on. Solve for $x$. But their noses can get very close to the\n",
    "page and they miss the opportunity to speed up the process by sitting back for a look at the bigger picture. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do not want is to only solve Aha problems. We want to solve extended problems--what I call hikes--with extended diligence of effort.  The nature of the hike, ideally, is to cover some different types of terrain and to arrive somewhere familiar at the end; 'back at the car'. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining mathematics as 'the exploration (invention?) of patterns using imagination, curiosity and reason' is intended as\n",
    "leverage to broaden perspective beyond classrooms and homework problems. Math class is to mathematics as a song is to music.\n",
    "Again there is a balance: How much of this high-falutin' has value versus takes up space? A good approach would be to read\n",
    "a bunch of Prefaces and see 'did this do enough / too much to set the tone?' \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a sports metaphor at work here as well, one that raises a difficult problem for the author. A basketball team plays a game and loses; and the team members reflect. Was the loss due to experiences in previous games, one game per week? Perhaps. But more important might be what happened in practice two nights per week over the season. But no: What really mattered was what did or did not happen every single day. Did the players go outside in their backyard or on the sidewalk and practice dribbling the ball? Shooting against the side of a building? Passing back and forth for hours with a friend? Sprinting down to the corner of the block, resting for ten seconds, and doing it again… and again… and again… until that became easier… and then going two blocks. In short: Repetitions help solidify our skills. The road through the mathematics landscape that is the school curriculum is full of repetitions. There is no substitute for 99.99% of us for doing hundreds or thousands of algebra problems. If you write down x you should automatically know you could also write that as $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x}}$ingerots  "

    "in a very fine British household with a large drawing room. It was winter, there was a nice fire in the\n",
    "fireplace, and she had some kittens to play with. In short she had it made. But there was a large mirror\n",

    "there a fire burning in the other room as well? Would the books on those shelves contain the same \n",
    "stories or different ones? And so pondering she eventually climbed up on the mantlepiece and stepped\n",
    "through the looking glass and into the other room to find out. (The glass had become tenuous like \n",
