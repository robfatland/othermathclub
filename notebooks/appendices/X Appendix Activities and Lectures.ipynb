    "- Bring me spiral counts\n",
    "- Prisoners with hats\n",
    "- Candy\n",
    "  - Everyone in a circle has an even number of wrapped pieces of candy. This varies randomly.\n",
    "  - Predict / try / write\n",
    "      - Give half your candy to the person on your left\n",
    "      - Receive a supply of candy from the person your right: simultaneously. \n",
    "      - Now recount your candy supply. \n",
    "      - If you now have an odd number of pieces take an extra from the reserve \n",
    "      - Repeat\n",
    "  - How many pieces of candy were there at the start? \n",
    "  - At the end? \n",
    "  - Instead: Eat odd pieces of candy to bring your pile back down to an even number? \n",
    "  - Give half your candy to the person on your left and the other half to the person on your right?\n",

    "- Expert Game\n",
    "  - logical fallacy\n",
    "    - *proof by assertion*\n",
    "    - *proof by appeal to authority*\n",
    "    - *disproof by questioning character*\n",
    "    - *proof by assuming the conclusion* \n",
    "  - Four participants: E, F, A and N. \n",
    "    - E is a genuine Expert who is usually right. \n",
    "    - F is a Failed Expert who holds ideas that can be shown to be wrong. \n",
    "    - A is Assertive: He claims to be right but his claims are untested. \n",
    "    - N is a normal person: She is presented by arguments from E, F and A.\n",
    "  - Presentation of $C$ will involve some research and preparation by E, F and A. \n",
    "    - Each of the three presenters has both a strategy and a method. \n",
    "    - The game proceeds in three rounds where the first round serves to set everything up:\n",
    "    - E is permitted to present $C$ but this is done without proof in the first round.\n",
    "    - F must present an alternative to $C$ that sounds much more plausible.\n",
    "    - A must either support E, support F or provide a third view.\n",
    "  - 1. E, F and A present arguments in a random order (or as chosen by N). \n",
    "    - N writes down which argument she believes is correct. \n",
    "  - 2. E, F and A provide a supporting statement. \n",
    "    - Again N writes down which argument she believes. \n",
    "    - She is welcome and encouraged even to change her mind. \n",
    "  - 3. E, F and A provide a revision statement. \n",
    "    - This statement is of the form \"Since my last remarks some new evidence has come to light...\" \n",
    "    - Followed by the revision or clarification. \n",
    "  - To set up the game our goal is to come up with a dubious claim that is nevertheless true. Call this claim $C$.\n",
    "      - E presents $C$ correctly.  Creative manipulation of $C$ makes the presentation doubtful. \n",
    "E is trying to get N to doubt the claim originally (by selecting one of the other two presenters)\n",
    "and then will try to get N to change their mind in stage 2 or stage 3. \n",
    "Therefore: Saying $C$ with a straight face is a good strategy, provided $C$ itself sounds \n",
    "outrageous and impossible. Ideally N does not believe E after round 1 but chooses F and/or A. \n",
    "In round 2 E is allowed to present a very short justification of why $C$ is true. E gets\n",
    "maximum score if N changes her mind after round 2. E gets fewer points if N changes her \n",
    "mind after round 3. In round 3 E is allowed to make a short supporting statement that \n",
    "must cite prior work. That is: Round 3 is an appeal to authority. The reason for this is \n",
    "that experts build on established ideas. \n",
    "      - F presents $C$ incorrectly; and should go to pains to make the claim sound very reasonable. F would like\n",
    "N to choose her argument first and continue to support that argument through to the end. F can either \n",
    "create false evidence or cite authority or resort to any other possibly unscrupulous means.\n",
    "      - A presents either support for F or support for N or a third idea. A gets maximum points if they \n",
    "can convince N to arrive at a wrong solution at the end of round 3; it does not matter what N\n",
    "decided in rounds 1 and 2. \n",
    "  - Example: E says \"Humans are built from mistaken copies of a computer program made from four instructions.\""

    "### Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two famous mathematicians -- Ulam and Von Neumann -- invented a method of exploring called **Monte Carlo**.\n",
    "- The method takes advantage of the speed of computers; and it requires the computers to generate random numbers.\n",
    "- We can simulate Monte Carlo by handing out some dice and recording sums. This is a case where we can also solve exactly.\n",
    "- We are using this to show how an actual experiment gets progressively closer to a theoretical result.\n",
    "- This leads to special attention to the words **theory** and **experiment**: What do they mean?\n",
    "- Compare this to the words **abstract** and **definite**\n",
    "- What are some examples of random sampling as a way of exploring?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's talk only about lines, triangles and circles\n",
    "- We shall begin by drawing by hand... I will draw a figure and you do likewise in your notebook\n",
    "- A line grazes a circle. Is it possible to touch at only one point? What is the angle?\n",
    "- Two circles can touch at only one point? What is the angle?\n",
    "- What does it mean, the center of a triangle? There are three...\n",
    "- How do we get the area of a triangle?\n",
    "- What is $C/d$? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* If all there was to infinity was $1\\;+\\;2\\;+\\;3\\;+\\;4\\;+\\;\\cdots\\;\\;\\;=\\infty$ then this lecture would be over.\n",
    "* There are two important ideas about infinity that I would like to share with you.\n",
    "  * Infinities that go outward and get very large. You can count them perhaps... but you never finish.\n",
    "  * Infinities that go on forever but grow smaller and smaller... so they add to something *not* infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time to introduce you to a District of Mathematics called Graph Theory. \n",
    "  - It is behind this gate but notice that the gate is locked. So first we unlock the gate with some key ideas. Get it?\n",
    "- We begin by defining a thing\n",
    "  - A **thing** is a thing. \n",
    "  - (It can't be defined without using another word that is just a synonym for *thing*.)\n",
    "- A **set** is a collection of things. \n",
    "  - (We give them labels to keep them straight: $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, ..., v_n\\}$)\n",
    "- A **graph** is two sets: A set of things we call V and a set of pairs of things from V we call E.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G=(V,E)=(\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, ...\\}, \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_3, v_5), ...\\})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Together V and E sound terribly abstract and hard to do anything with. \n",
    "  - But good news: We can easily draw a picture of a graph $G = (V, E)$.\n",
    "  - See the bison up above\n",
    "- Notice that this *thing* here and this *thing* here are connected. \n",
    "  - So the first *thing* has a name $v_1$...\n",
    "  - ...but we can also point to it and say it is that *thing* connected to this other *thing*. \n",
    "  - Just as you know my *name* but you also know me as *acquaintance of Ms.H*. \n",
    "- There is an equivalence between writing out the sets and drawing the picture\n",
    "  - They correspond, no matter how we rearrange the picture\n",
    "    - Just as I can move around the room and Ms. H can move around the room...\n",
    "      - That does change that we are mutually acquainted. \n",
    "- Now we have just enough to say that the gates to Graph Theory are open. \n",
    "  - Let's step through, and the first thing we will do is attend a party...\n",
    "  \n",
    "* Let's say an odd number of people are at the party. Can everyone shake hands an odd number of times? You may not\n",
    "refuse a handshake and you may not shake hands with yourself. \n",

    "### Numbers and Diophantus\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write 'Diophantus 240 Fermat 1640 Wiles 1994' on the board\n",
    "- You know and I know that sometimes answers are 1.2 or 2/3... not whole numbers like 6 or 19\n",
    "- But did you know there are certain problems that *require* the answers to be whole numbers? \n",
    "- Suppose you survey a barnyard and notice there are only cows and chickens... and you count 42 legs and 42 ears. \n",
    "How many chickens are there? What does a negative chicken look like?\n",
    "- Ok let's review our sanity check -- do all problems play fair? -- and revise it to 100 legs and 42 ears. Now how many\n",
    "chickens are there? \n",
    "- Problems that have whole number solutions are called Diophantine problems, after Diophantus. \n",
    "- Diophantus wrote *Arithemetica* in AD240... a book of math problems and solutions...\n",
    "- ...and 1400 years later while reading a copy of this book Pierre de Fermat\n",
    "claimed that there are no positive integer solutions to $a^n+b^n=c^n$ for $n>2$... \n",
    "  - He said he had a proof but it would not fit in the margin\n",
    "- ...and this claim of Fermat was shown to be true in 1994 by Andrew Wiles, 354 years after Fermat suggested it\n",
    "- Meanwhile we have $n=2$ which looks thus and is related to the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles\n",
    "- So it is ok for Pythagoras... just not for bigger exponents, for positive integers\n",
    "- Let's make a couple more remarks about numbers\n",
    "  - We use base 10... with 10 symbols we write 471 with the idea of *place* but what is this in base 7 or base 2?\n",
    "  - We know that if $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$ then $24$ is divisible by $8$ and by $3$ but $25$ is divsible by neither\n",
    "  - 1 is 1. 2 is prime. 3 is prime. 4 is composite. 5 is prime. And so on. \n",
    "    - After 1 you are either a prime or you can be factored into primes.\n",
    "- Once you have the basic terms down for numbers you can go quite far... let's do one problem\n",
    "  - What is an easy way of figuring out if some big number is divisible by 9?"

    "### Negative One Squared\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose I were to ask you what is $1 \\times 1$  How about $1 \\times -1$? $-1 \\times 1$? $-1 \\times -1$? \n",
    "- We can redefine **number** to be **anything that follows the rules of arithmetic**\n",
    "- In particular let us take regular numbers in pairs and call them **complicated numbers**\n",
    "- If we can come up with rules of addition and multiplication then we have an entirely new number system!\n",
    "- To make progress we will have to agree that there are four ways of writing these new numbers\n",
    "  - This is rather like graphs that have set notation as well as picture notation\n",
    "- The four ways are: $(a, b)$, $re^{i\\theta}$, 'draw a dot on the plane', $a \\;+\\;ib$\n",
    "- Each of these has its uses but we will use the first two to define addition and multiplication\n",
    "- The final step is to notice that the real numbers are a part of the complex numbers.\n",
    "  - Therefore we can use complex multiplication to discover that $-1 \\times -1 = 1$"
