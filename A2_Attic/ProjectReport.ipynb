    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typical enrollment is \"high enthusiasm and some attrition over the school year\"\n",
    "    - 45 Tyee students sign up, primarily 6th graders\n",
    "    - Participation at end of the school year: Typically 20 students\n",
    "- Meeting schedule: 90 minutes on Wednesday evening e.g. 6:30 -- 8:00PM\n",
    "    - Meetings are cancelled on holidays and when conflicts with Tyee events come up\n",
    "- Staff: Seven coaches plus one parent Director\n",
    "- Objectives: Learn coding in the context of mathematics and science\n",
    "    - A more comprehensive review is provided below\n",
    "- Reasons for student participation: From Q&A with the students:\n",
    "    - Interest in computer programming\n",
    "    - Interest in computer games\n",
    "    - Opportunity to socialize with peers\n",
    "    - Parental guidance\n",
    "- Curriculum: Open science principles; and \"away from the keyboard\" thinking\n",
    "    - Curriculum content: See [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/robfatland/othermathclub)\n",
    "        - Primarily Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "        - *thinking* particularly includes simple systems\n",
    "    - Basics of the Python programming language (loops, data structures, execution logic etc)\n",
    "    - Python libraries (turtle graphics, requests etc)\n",
    "    - Mathematics: Simple systems; interesting results; experimentation\n",
    "        - Examples: \n",
    "    - Science\n",

    "- Asks of participating students and their guardians\n",
    "    - Define participation in terms of what is required, stated at the outset\n",
    "        - You agree to participate in a manner described in the Code of Conduct\n",
    "        - You have a working Python environment on a reliable, powered laptop\n",
    "        - You show up to club meetings with your laptop in a charged state\n",
    "        - You put in 90 minutes at the club with emphasis on club activities\n",
    "            - Socializing is welcome but it is up to the student to maintain that as secondary\n",
    "        - If you have to miss a club meeting you commit to making up the work from a Guidesheet\n",
    "        - You put in 90 minutes per week doing Python programming on your own\n",
    "        - You thoughtfully fill out assessment forms when requested\n",
    "        - Parents volunteer to attend at least one club meeting: Coordinated with the director\n",
    "- Coaches are not formally trained teachers\n",
    "    - This is an acute problem when dealing with occasional unconstructive behavior\n",
    "    - Fast parent involvement\n",
    "- Student disengagement on three fronts\n",
    "    - Most common: Social behavior with peers\n",
    "    - Related: Diversion to computer games etcetera\n",
    "    - Also frequent: Not sure what I should be doing / how to make progress\n",

    "    - It is a great asset to have parents attend on a voluntary basis\n",
    "    - Specific roles/guidance needed\n",
    "        - Students coalesce in the library: Restrict the sprawl\n",
    "        - Students move to classroom: Restrict the sprawl again\n",
    "        - Kinesthetics: Be present, help maintain focus\n",
    "        - Coding and generally: Disengagement intervention: \"Charles show me what you're working on\"\n",
    "- Name recognition\n",
    "    - Implement sign-in on arrival (library open seating area, consolidated)\n",
    "    - On sign-in: Name tag (lanyard or sticker)\n",
    "    - Coaches practice using student names *frequently*\n",
    "- Student skill variability: No prior experience necessary to participate\n",
    "    - One advanced class\n",
    "    - One or two fundamentals classes\n",
    "- Learning Python fundamentals\n",
    "    - See below: A list of primary (functional) and secondary (conceptual/strategic) principles\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are essentially two elements of student life that feed 99% of the behavioral issues we face\n",
    "over the course of the year. The first is the vice-like grip that computer games and other online\n",
    "content have on the minds of students. Given as little as 15 seconds without supervision or direction,\n",
    "80% of club participants will invariably open their laptops and begin playing a game. Furthermore\n",
    "a significant subset of participating students will revert to game play *even when* they are \n",
