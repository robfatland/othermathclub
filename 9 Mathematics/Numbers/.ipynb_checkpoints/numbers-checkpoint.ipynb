    "Rather I looked at two digit numbers like $11$. \n",
    "For $11$ sure enough the alternating sum works: $1-1=0$ and that is divisible by 11 since *any* number divides into zero\n",
    "zero times with zero remainder.\n",
    "It is the same for $22$ and $33$ and so on up until I hit $209$.\n",
    "That is: The alternating sum of digits was always $0$.\n",
    "Since all of the multiples of $11$ less than $209$ have a digit sum of zero... well: That follows \n",
    "the rule but it is a bit trivial. \n",
    "Finally I arrived at $209$ where we have $2-0+9=11$ so it is more interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I sat back and spent some time thinking about other numbers and the alternating sums of their digits. \n",
    "I had various unproductive thoughts like 'any number with an even number of digits all the same is \n",
    "divisible by $11$', for example $33333333333333333333333333333$. All the digits cancel out in the \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So rather than try to solve the entire divisibility-by-11 problem at once I started with a simple case. \n",
    "I said 'Let's try $22$...'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also I had the 'divisible by 3' rule in mind which sounds similar to the case for $11$: Just a regular \n",
    "digit sum rather than an alternating sum. (This is described on the previous notebook, **Numbers 3**.\n",
    "The plan for $3$ was to reduce the power of ten (say $1000$) to a sum:  Something divisible by $3$ \n",

    "\n",
    "I write: $22=2\\cdot10+2$. I stare at this for a time. That $10$ stares back. The problem is about $11$. So stealing\n",
    "the idea from the divisiblity-by-3 problem I decide to write $10$ as $11-1$. Aha. There is a minus sign. \n",
    "The alternating sum involves minus signs. Maybe this is the right direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact: From here on everything is going to work out great. I have been lucky twice: First because I already \n",

    "be a good guess that *works* for $11$. So even *this* is like the rabbit out of the hat because my first guess\n",
    "was a good one. Elsewhere in this library I will describe wrong guesses that lead down blind alleys; but in\n",
    "this case I got lucky in this way at the outset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From here on out it is a matter of calculations leading the way. Let's do that.\n",
