A second train departs from Peoria towards Chicago on the same track at the same time at the same speed. Uh oh... it seems that they will eventually crash into one another. Meanwhile a little bee who can fly very quickly flies back and forth between the two trains along the track. She flies at 150 miles per hour. She begins this back-and-forth flight path just as the two trains start off. Now the two trains will eventually collide but happily they are automated trains with nobody on board so nobody gets hurt. At the last instant the bee flies upwards so she is not hurt either. Whew. But the question is: Between the trains starting off and colliding how far does the little bee fly? "

    "\n",
    "### More knights and knaves\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Smullyan has given us problems about Knights and Knaves. Knights always tell the truth. Knaves always lie.\n",
    "The quality of being a knight or a knave is a person's *type*. \n",
    "These interesting people live on an island that you happen to be visiting. As you are walking along the road you \n",
    "happen upon two residents A and B who make the following statements:\n",

    "```\n",
    "A: B is a knave.\n",

    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The word 'if' comes in handy; or you may prefer the word 'suppose'... \n",
    "\n",
    "A is either a knight or a knave. Suppose A is a knight. Then B is indeed a \n",

    "## Challenging Logic Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain students have asked for challenging problems involving logic. \n",
    "Here are a few I'm aware of... \n",
    "\n",
    "### The *perfect logician* premise\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems often involve persons participating. I use the term *mathematician* to indicate someone\n",
    "who is instantly able to reach correct logical conclusions from information given to them. This person\n",
    "is sometimes called a *perfect logician*. This premise allows you to avoid thinking about trick answers.\n",
    "These problems are about application of logic, not finding trick answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Two numbers and two mathematicians\n",
    "\n",
    "Two mathematicians $S$ and $P$ are told that integers $x$ and $y$ have been chosen such that \n",
    "$1 < x < y$ and $x+y < 100$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$S$ is given the value $x+y$.\n",
    "$P$ is given the value $xy$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They have the following conversation (all true statements):\n",
    "\n",
    "**P**:  I cannot determine the two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**S**:  I knew that.\n",
    "\n",
    "**P**:  Oh really? Well now I know what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**S**:  Oh really? Well now so do I.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are $x$ and $y$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conway's Wizards\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is similar to the one above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Last night I sat behind two wizards on a bus, and overheard the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A: “I have a positive integral number of children, whose ages are positive integers, \n",
    "the sum of which is the number of this bus, while the product is my own age.” \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B: “How interesting! Perhaps if you told me your age and the number of your children, \n",
    "I could work out their individual ages?” \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A: “No.” \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B: “Aha! AT LAST I know how old you are!”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now: What was the number of the bus?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prisoners and hats\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem concerns prisoners who must determine the color of hats placed on their heads that they\n",
    "can not see. The hats are red or black. While each prisoner is unable to see the color of his or her \n",
    "own hat some prisoners can see the hats of other prisoners. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Prisoners are not allowed to speak except to declare the color of the hat on their head. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The important point is that the prisoner may say 'my hat is red' or 'my hat is black' but they must otherwise \n",
    "remain silent. In some cases a prisoner is forbidden from speaking at all regardless of what they know. \n",
    "This is explained further below. If a prisoner correctly identifies their hat color all of the prisoners\n",
    "are released. We are not interested in guessing here; only in cases where prisoners can be certain of \n",
    "their hat color.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a particular prisoner-hat problem using three (or four) numbers: $(p, b, r \\left[,q\\right])$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $p$ is the number of prisoners\n",
    "  - they are placed in a line of chairs facing to the left\n",
    "  - they are numbered $1, 2, 3, \\dots, p$ from left to right\n",
    "  - as they face to to the left: $2$ can see the hat of $1$ but not of $3$. $3$ can see the hats of $1$ and $2$, and so on\n",
    "  - ...therefore prisoner $p$ can see the other $p-1$ prisoners' hats\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $b$ is the number of *black* hats in the hat bin\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $r$ is the number of *red* hats in the hat bin\n",
    "  - hats are placed on prisoner's heads from the bin\n",
    "  - some hats may be left over and not placed on anyone's head\n",
    "  - all of the prisoners know how many hats of each color are in the bin\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- $q$ is optional: The number of prisoners starting at the far right who may not speak\n",
    "  - prisoners who do not speak may realize their own hat color but everyone knows they are prevented from speaking\n",
    "  - if a number is not given for $q$ then $q=0$ and anyone may speak\n",
    "\n",
    "Now a problem can be phrased 'Given a particular (p, b, r, q) will the prisoners go free?' \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (1, 1, 0) the prisoner immediately says 'my hat is black' since there is only one (black) hat. He goes free.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (1, 1, 0, 1) the prisoner may not speak, alas. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (1, 1, 1) the prisoner's hat is either black or red so he has no way of being certain. He can only guess but\n",
    "this is not allowed, alas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (2, 1, 1) we have two prisoners. Prisoner 1 sees nothing and is silent. Prisoner 2 sees a hat of one color (red or black)\n",
    "and immediately says he is wearing a hat of the opposite color (black or red) since there are only two hats. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For (2, 2, 0) either prisoner can announce that he is wearing a black hat. Remember that they both know how many\n",
    "hats there are of each color in the hat bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we make the problems more complicated. Problems are solvable by the prisoners only if they are \n",
    "solvable for any and every possible sequence of hats. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What about (3, 2, 1)? This is easily solved by $3$. What about (3, 2, 2) where one hat is left over? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(5, 3, 2) is easily solved by prisoner $5$... but what about (5,3,2,1)? In this case prisoner $5$ may not speak.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Is (6, 10, 1) solvable? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you set yourself some additional problems and solve them you may start to develop an idea of which\n",
    "hat problems are solvable. \n",
    "The abstract and difficult problem here is actually this: If you have $p$ prisoners and $b=p$ black hats: \n",
    "What is the largest number of red hats you can have such that the problem is still solvable?  If you\n",
    "solve this problem then all prisoner-hat problems become instantly decideable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eye color problem as given by Randall Munroe, paraphrased\n",
    "\n",
    "A certain fellow named Randall Munroe has carefully presented the problem given below. \n",
    "I have done a little paraphrasing; he gets 100% of the credit for popularizing this problem.\n",
    "I transcribe the problem here to decouple it from other web content.\n",

    "*Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes must leave the island on the ferry, and the rest stay.*\n",
    "*Everyone can see everyone else at all times.*\n",

    "\n",
    "*On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru.*\n",
    "*The Guru happens to have green eyes.* \n",
    "*So any blue-eyed person sees 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green).*\n",

    "we feel certain that some sort of pattern will be apparent!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in working on this problem is to use your imagination. Clearly since our equations have the number 1\n",
    "in them as well as the number 0 we are talking about numbers. However we have learned that numbers are not necessarily\n",
    "the real numbers we are familiar with. In fact if you look at the third equation \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x^2+1=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that if $x$ is a real number then $x^2$ is a positive number unless $x=0$. If $x=0$ then $x^2=0$. So in both\n",
    "cases when we add $1$ to this we will not get to zero. That is, $x^2+1$ is *never* zero if we use real numbers. \n",
    "What other types of numbers do we know about that we could use to work on this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you have guessed it!  We need to solve this problem on the complex plane. So now I will invite you to imagine an\n",
    "extended metaphor called the Dance Party. Imagine you have entered a vast ballroom. On the\n",
    "floor near the center is painted a dot, the origin. At a distance of one hopskip from that dot is drawn a circle. \n",
    "(A hopskip is about 5 yards.) Since this is a radius of one it is of course a unit circle. \n",
    "And then lastly at right angles through the dot are drawn two lines which are the real and the imaginary\n",
    "coordinate axes, $\\Re$ and $\\Im$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what happens? A girl comes into the room. She is carrying a guitar and wearing roller skates. She is wearing a \n",
    "t-shirt upon which is written the expression $x^2+1$. She begins singing and playing the guitar. Both the singing and\n",
    "the guitar are at a medium volume level as she stands in one location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You walk over and start pushing her around the dance floor. She does not seem to mind but you notice that as \n",
    "you move her the volume of both the guitar and the singing change. Furthermore sometimes the music is in a \n",
    "major key and sometimes in a minor key. Finally you notice that whenever you roll her to some point on the \n",
    "Real axis she stops playing the guitar entirely. It falls silent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is going on here?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The girl wearing the function t-shirt is a representation of that function. She is only one place at a time -- which\n",
    "we refer to as $x$ -- but she can \n",
    "be relocated to any other point on the complex plane; which would be a different $x$. \n",
    "Wherever she is on the dance floor can be represented as a complex number\n",
    "$x=(a, b)$. The number $a$ is the real coordinate of $x$. The number $b$ is the imaginary coordinate of $x$. \n",
    "Notice that both $a$ and $b$ are themselves real numbers. \n",
    "That is: The complex number $x$ is simply a pair of real numbers $a$ and $b$ written\n",
    "as $(a, b)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at any given location (complex number) the function can be calculated. But this function of a complex number\n",
    "is itself also a complex number that we will write $(s, g)$. The value of $s$ is represented by how loud the girl\n",
    "is singing. The value of $g$ is how loud she is playing the guitar. Since both $s$ and $g$ are real numbers they\n",
    "may be either positive or negative. When $s$ is positive she sings in a major key. When $s$ is negative she sings\n",
    "in a minor key; and likewise with the guitar. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have imagined a way of representing a complex-valued function on the complex plane. We can send this particular\n",
    "girl out to switch t-shirts to one of the other functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when the girl crosses the real axis her guitar falls silent. Let's discuss why this happens. If the \n",
    "guitar falls silent that means that the imaginary part of the function is zero. Suppose you push the girl onto \n",
    "the real axis somewhere and then begin pushing her along the real axis. At each location she calculates $x^2+1$.\n",
    "On the real axis the imaginary coordinate is zero; so the number looks like $(a, 0)$. When you square this \n",
    "number you will get $(a^2, 0)$ which is also a real number with zero imaginary part. Since the guitar volume\n",
    "is the imaginary number, and since that is zero, the guitar is silent. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have discovered a set of locations (the real axis) where the imaginary part of the function is zero. \n",
    "However what we are interested in is where the function goes entirely to zero, which is $(0, 0)$. That is, \n",
    "when we have the equation $x^2+1=0$ we are saying 'the function $x^2 + 1$ falls to zero *somewhere*; and\n",
    "where is that? Where does the girl stop playing the guitar *and* stop singing?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that the girl stops playing the guitar on the real axis: Perhaps we should look carefully along the\n",
    "real axis to see if there are some places where she also stops singing. Then we will have some solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it would be a good idea to review what zero means. In real numbers zero is just $0$. It is the origin. \n",
    "For complex numbers -- which are two real numbers -- zero is just what you would expect: $(0, 0)$. So for our\n",
    "function $x^2+1$ to reach a value of zero both the real part and the imaginary part must be zero. We have already\n",
    "shown that $x$ cannot be on the real axis because any real number squared plus one is greater than zero. Therefore\n",
    "we must search off of the real axis for good values of $x$. Such good values when squared and added to $1$ are equal\n",
    "to zero. Therefore when they are squared they must equal $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The great advantage of using distance+angle to represent complex \n",

    "\n",
    "$$r^2\\cdot e^{i 2 \\theta} = 1\\cdot e^{i\\pi}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Now: You begin with a large equilateral triangle that you cut into four smaller equilateral triangles, \n",

    "you multiply by another factor of $3/4$; and this never stops. You keep cutting smaller and \n",

    "#### Solution Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in working on this problem is to use your imagination. Clearly since our equations have the number 1\n",
    "in them as well as the number 0 we are talking about numbers. However we have learned that numbers are not necessarily\n",

    "\n",
    "$$x^2+1=0$$\n",

    "\n",

    "cases when we add $1$ to this we will not get to zero. That is, $x^2+1$ is *never* zero if we use real numbers. \n",
    "What other types of numbers do we know about that we could use to work on this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you have guessed it!  We need to solve this problem on the complex plane. So now I will invite you to imagine an\n",
    "extended metaphor called the Dance Party. Imagine you have entered a vast ballroom. On the\n",
    "floor near the center is painted a dot, the origin. At a distance of one hopskip from that dot is drawn a circle. \n",
    "(A hopskip is about 5 yards.) Since this is a radius of one it is of course a unit circle. \n",
    "And then lastly at right angles through the dot are drawn two lines which are the real and the imaginary\n",
    "coordinate axes, $\\Re$ and $\\Im$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what happens? A girl comes into the room. She is carrying a guitar and wearing roller skates. She is wearing a \n",
    "t-shirt upon which is written the expression $x^2+1$. She begins singing and playing the guitar. Both the singing and\n",
    "the guitar are at a medium volume level as she stands in one location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You walk over and start pushing her around the dance floor. She does not seem to mind but you notice that as \n",
    "you move her the volume of both the guitar and the singing change. Furthermore sometimes the music is in a \n",
    "major key and sometimes in a minor key. Finally you notice that whenever you roll her to some point on the \n",
    "Real axis she stops playing the guitar entirely. It falls silent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is going on here?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The girl wearing the function t-shirt is a representation of that function. She is only one place at a time -- which\n",
    "we refer to as $x$ -- but she can \n",
    "be relocated to any other point on the complex plane; which would be a different $x$. \n",
    "Wherever she is on the dance floor can be represented as a complex number\n",
    "$x=(a, b)$. The number $a$ is the real coordinate of $x$. The number $b$ is the imaginary coordinate of $x$. \n",
    "Notice that both $a$ and $b$ are themselves real numbers. \n",
    "That is: The complex number $x$ is simply a pair of real numbers $a$ and $b$ written\n",
    "as $(a, b)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at any given location (complex number) the function can be calculated. But this function of a complex number\n",
    "is itself also a complex number that we will write $(s, g)$. The value of $s$ is represented by how loud the girl\n",
    "is singing. The value of $g$ is how loud she is playing the guitar. Since both $s$ and $g$ are real numbers they\n",
    "may be either positive or negative. When $s$ is positive she sings in a major key. When $s$ is negative she sings\n",
    "in a minor key; and likewise with the guitar. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have imagined a way of representing a complex-valued function on the complex plane. We can send this particular\n",
    "girl out to switch t-shirts to one of the other functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that when the girl crosses the real axis her guitar falls silent. Let's discuss why this happens. If the \n",
    "guitar falls silent that means that the imaginary part of the function is zero. Suppose you push the girl onto \n",
    "the real axis somewhere and then begin pushing her along the real axis. At each location she calculates $x^2+1$.\n",
    "On the real axis the imaginary coordinate is zero; so the number looks like $(a, 0)$. When you square this \n",
    "number you will get $(a^2, 0)$ which is also a real number with zero imaginary part. Since the guitar volume\n",
    "is the imaginary number, and since that is zero, the guitar is silent. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have discovered a set of locations (the real axis) where the imaginary part of the function is zero. \n",
    "However what we are interested in is where the function goes entirely to zero, which is $(0, 0)$. That is, \n",
    "when we have the equation $x^2+1=0$ we are saying 'the function $x^2 + 1$ falls to zero *somewhere*; and\n",
    "where is that? Where does the girl stop playing the guitar *and* stop singing?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we know that the girl stops playing the guitar on the real axis: Perhaps we should look carefully along the\n",
    "real axis to see if there are some places where she also stops singing. Then we will have some solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it would be a good idea to review what zero means. In real numbers zero is just $0$. It is the origin. \n",
    "For complex numbers -- which are two real numbers -- zero is just what you would expect: $(0, 0)$. So for our\n",
    "function $x^2+1$ to reach a value of zero both the real part and the imaginary part must be zero. We have already\n",
    "shown that $x$ cannot be on the real axis because any real number squared plus one is greater than zero. Therefore\n",
    "we must search off of the real axis for good values of $x$. Such good values when squared and added to $1$ are equal\n",
    "to zero. Therefore when they are squared they must equal $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So in other words there is a complex number with a non-zero imaginary part that you can square to get $-1$. Then\n",
    "you add $1$ and you arrive at zero = $0$ = $(0, 0)$ = (no singing, no guitar). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course you know that $x = i$ works; but let's write that in terms of coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = i = (0, 1) = e^{\\;i \\frac{\\pi}{2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Part 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that we have jumped into the Distance-Angle representation \n",
    "of complex numbers. In fact we have four differen ways to write\n",
    "a complex number...\n",
    "\n",
    "- as a point on a diagram\n",
    "- as two coordinates $(a, b)$\n",
    "- as the same two coordinates with an $i$: $a + ib$\n",
    "- as a distance and an angle $re^{\\;i\\theta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last representation has distance $r$ and angle $\\theta$ where \n",
    "the angle is measured in radians. This is the distance around the\n",
    "unit circle so 180 *degrees* is $\\pi$ radians. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The great advantage of using distance+angle to represent complex \n",
    "numbers is that they are very easy to multiply. If you wish to\n",
    "multiply two complex numbers you arrive at a third complex number\n",
    "as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$re^{i\\theta} \\cdot se^{i\\gamma} = r\\cdot s \\cdot e^{i(\\theta+\\gamma)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is you multiply the two distances and you add the two angles\n",
    "to arrive at the product of the two complex numbers. Let's use this\n",
    "rule to square a complex number since we are thinking about the\n",
    "function $x^2+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(re^{i\\theta})^2=r\\cdot r \\cdot e^{i(\\theta+\\theta)}=r^2e^{i 2 \\theta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember we are looking for where the guitar and the singing \n",
    "both fall silent; and that happens where $x^2$ is equal to negative\n",
    "one. Therefore let's set $x^2$ equal to $-1$... but let's write both\n",
    "of them in distance-angle notation also.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r^2\\cdot e^{i 2 \\theta} = 1\\cdot e^{i\\pi}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So this means that $r^2=1$ and $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. So we have\n",

    "\n",
    "Now: You begin with a large equilateral triangle that you cut into four smaller equilateral triangles, \n",

    "You can continue with this procedure until your remaining triangles are very small indeed. In \n",
    "fact you can continue this forever (in the mathematical sense).\n",

    "#### Tristan's Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tristan's solution is much more elegant than mine. My approach was to keep cutting smaller\n",
    "and smaller triangles out of the starting triangle and add up all the pieces.  However: If like Tristan\n",
    "you ask yourself not 'How much void area is gone?' but rather 'How much colored-in area remains?' you \n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose you start with the entire triangle colored in; and suppose it has area $1$ square unit. Now remove \n",

    "the next step in the iterative void-cutting process where you have the three large remaining colored \n",
    "triangles and you remove the center sub-triangle from each of those. How much space remains? Well it \n",
    "is going to be $3/4$ of the remainder\n",
    "you had before, after the first step, because you just removed $1/4$ of that remainder. \n",
    "So it is $3/4$ of $3/4$ or $9/16$ remaining area. \n",
    "Repeat the process again and how much remains? $3/4$ of $9/16$. In fact at each successive step\n",
    "you multiply by another factor of $3/4$; and this never stops. You keep cutting smaller and \n",
    "smaller voids out of the remaining triangles forever. So the question is 'What is $3/4$ raised\n",
    "to the infinity power?' And the answer is of course zero. No colored-in area remains. \n",

    "To be honest this claim seems wobbly... let's see what happens when I try to prove it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We know $n^2$ is even. This means that $2$ is one of the \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice two things, please: First we *imagine* a prime number $p$ but it might be one of\n",
    "several so we give it a little subscript, the number $1$, so it looks like $p_1$. This is multiplied\n",
    "by $p_2$, and so on. The notation allows for a whole bunch of primes multiplied together\n",
    "to arrive at $n$. But $n$ might be a prime number. If that is the case then $n=p_1$\n",
    "and there are no other primes involved. Writing in this way expresses the abstract\n",
    "nature of $n$ (we don't know how many prime factors it has) together with the definite\n",
    "nature of $n$ (it is *most definitely* prime or the product of primes).\n",
    "\n",

    "$n^2\\;=\\;2\\cdot q=n\\cdot n=p_1\\cdot p_2\\cdot p_3\\cdot p_4\\cdots p_i\\cdot p_1\\cdot p_2\\cdot p_3\\cdot p_4\\cdots p_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In words: One of the prime factors of $n^2$ is $2$ because $n^2$ is even. \n",
    "Since $n^2$ is $n$ times $n$ we know all the prime factors of $n$ appear \n",
    "twice in the prime factorization of $n^2$.\n",
    "Also $n^2$ has only *one* prime factorization. (The order of the factors can change\n",

    "$n$ appear in the prime factorization of $n^2$. Since $2$ is one of those prime\n",
    "factors it follows that $2$ is a prime\n",
    "factor of $n$ and so $n$ must be even. \n",
    "\n",
    "My claim is wrong. If $n^2$ is even then $n$ must also be even.\n",
    "\n",

    "**A number $n$ is prime if and only if $n$ divides evenly into $(n-1)! + 1$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $n$ divides evenly into $(n-1)!+1$. Then $n$ must be a prime because if $n$ was not\n",
    "a prime we would have an impossible situation. $n$ would be the product of at least two\n",
    "numbers less than $n$ and greater than $1$. Let's say these are $a$ and $b$ and it does not\n",
    "matter if they are prime or not. Both $a$ and $b$ appear in the list of factors of \n",
    "$(n-1)!$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(n-1)! \\;=\\;1\\;\\cdot\\;2\\;\\cdot\\;3\\;\\cdot\\;4\\;\\cdot\\;\\dots\\;\\cdot\\;a\\;\\cdot\\;\\dots\\;\\cdot\\;b\n",
    "\\;\\cdot\\;\\dots\\;\\cdot\\;(n-3)\\;\\cdot\\;(n-2)\\;\\cdot\\;(n-1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both $a$ and $b$ divide evenly into this number (they are factors of it) they do not divide into this number\n",
    "plus one. This is easy to see by example: $5$ divides into $20$ and therefore does not divide into $21$. So to repeat:\n",
    "$a$ and $b$ do not divide into $(n-1)!+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is the problem, first by example: If $2$ and $3$ multiplied together make $6$ then any number divisible\n",
    "by $6$ is also divisible by $2$ and $3$. In our proof: If the number $n$ divides into $(n-1)!+1$ and $n$ \n",
    "is the product of $a$ and $b$ then both $a$ and $b$ must divide into $(n-1)!+1$ as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize our last two conclusions: If $n$ is not prime then \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- $a$ and $b$ *do* divide into $(n-1)!+1$\n",
    "- $a$ and $b$ *do not* divide into $(n-1)!+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is impossible. Therefore $n$ is not composite. Therefore $n$ is a prime. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In short\n",
    "if $n$ divides into $(n-1)!+1$ then $n$ is prime because a factor of $n$ must but cannot divide into $(n-1)!+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is the first part of the\n",
    "proof, that *if* $n$ divides into $(n-1)!+1$ then $n$ is prime. The next part is more difficult: We still need\n",
    "to show that $n$ **must** divide into $(n-1)!+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is only one even prime ($2$) let us agree that $2$ divides into $(2-1)!+1=2$. Only the odd primes\n",
    "remain. We could keep working examples ($3$ divides into $2!+1$, $5 divides into $4!+1$ and so on... but this \n",
    "is a losing game knowing as we do that the number of primes is infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "So taking $n$ to be an odd prime: Does $n$ divide evenly into $(n-1)!+1$ every time? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Working through an example \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the odd prime $13$. Rather than show that it divides evenly into $12!+1$ (which it does) let's \n",
    "take a moment to look at all the numbers from $1$ to $12$ (since $12 = 13 - 1$). I will list pairs of numbers\n",
    "and their products in this 12-element set.\n",
    "\n",
    "$1\\cdot1=1=0\\cdot11+1$\n",

    "$6\\cdot11=66=13\\cdot5+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$12\\cdot12=144=13\\cdot11+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "That shows that each member of the set {1, 2, 3, ..., 12} matches with another (in two cases the same)\n",
    "to product a product congruent to $1$ *modulo* $13$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we switch to abstract terms. $13$ becomes some prime $p$. Some number in the set \n",
    "$\\{ 1, ..., (p-1) \\}$ becomes $x$. Then $xy \\equiv 1(mod\\;p)$ is the congruence we are\n",
    "discussing. The claim is that there is only one way to do all the matchings of $x$ to $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here we go. Let's consider all possible pairings $y$ as products for some $x$ in the $\\{ 1, ..., (p-1) \\}$ set:\n",
    "$P=\\{ x, 2x, 3x, ..., (p-1)x \\}$. This new set $P$ is the product set for $x$ where $x$ is paired with other numbers \n",
    "of the $\\{ 1, ..., (p-1) \\}$ set including somewhere in there the product $x^2$ for when $y$ happens to equal $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose two of these numbers in this set of products are congruent mod p; say for different elements $r$ and $s$. \n",
    "Then $rx\\equiv sx(mod\\;p)$ and so $(r-s)x\\equiv 0(mod\\;p)$. This means that $p$ divides into $(r-s)x$ with no\n",
    "remainder; so $p$ must divide into $(r-s)$ or $x$ since $p$ is prime. However $(r-s$) is not zero and $x$ is\n",
    "not zero and so both $(r-s)$ and $x$ are too small for $p$ to divide into them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since none of the members of $P$ are congruent to any others modulo $p$ each must have its own modulus. \n",
    "Furthermore none of them is divisible by $p$ so their mod $p$ value may not be zero. There are, fortunately,\n",
    "exactly $(p-1)$ possible remainders and $(p-1)$ elements in $P$ so these must match up. One of them has\n",
    "a modulus (remainder) of $1$ for the chosen value of $x$. This is a unique matching for that remainder. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We noted above that $x$ might be matched with itself. Considering that possibility that $x^2\\equiv 1(mod\\;p)$\n",
    "we see that $p$ divides evenly into $x^2-1$ so both $x=1$ and $x=(p-1)$ will work. The other values of $x$\n",
    "will not partner $x$ with itself to achieve congruence to $1$ mod $p$. There is an even number of $x$ values\n",
    "remaining so every number both *can* and *must* have a matching number to give $xy \\equiv 1(mod\\;p)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficult step is next. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If $a\\equiv 1(mod\\;p)$ and $b\\equiv 2(mod\\;p)$ then $a$ and $b$ are both multiples of $p$ plus $1$. \n",
    "Written this way they can be multipled; giving various cross terms that are multiples of $p$ plus that\n",
    "$1 \\times 1 = 1$ term at the end. So their product is *also* congruent to $1$ modulo $p$. So numbering\n",

    "## Four Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "Four identical bugs A, B, C and D are placed on the corners of a square table one meter on a side. \n",
    "A faces B who faces C who faces D who faces A. Each bug immediately begins walking towards the bug it faces.\n",
    "How far does each walk before they converge at the center of the table?\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional: Picture the two diagonals of the table. Do the bugs' paths cross over these diagonals? If so: How many times? \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional: Suppose there are an arbitrary number of bugs $n$ placed at the vertices of a regular polygon. They begin walking towards the next bug along the perimeter. How far do these bugs travel before they meet in the center? For this generalization of the problem let's standardize the side of the polygon to have length $a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "As each bug walks towards the next on the perimeter of the square the four \n",
    "bugs will spiral inwards and meet at the center of the square arena. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each bug travels 1 meter\n",
    "* Each bug does cross the diagonals of the original square as they spiral in to the center.\n",
    "* The number of diagonals each bug crosses is unbounded (<math>\\infty</math>).\n",
    "\n",
    "This revisits Zeno's paradox: Each bug finds itself stepping over the diagonals an \n",
    "infinite number of times on a finite walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an argument that the third result (infinite diagonal crossings) follows from the second:\n",
    "\n",
    "$A$ faces and begins walking towards $B$ on the original table top; where $B$'s starting location coincides \n",
    "with a diagonal of the square. Call this the pending diagonal of $A$ since $A$ walks in that direction. \n",
    "Suppose $A$ crosses over the pending diagonal; but not at the center.  At this moment all four bugs are \n",
    "crossing their respective pending diagonals. The shape of their arrangement is still a square. \n",
    "Hence the original problem has been scaled down to a smaller version of itself: The bugs occupy the four corners \n",
    "of a smaller square concentric with the original square.  Each bug has traveled through 90 degrees as seen \n",
    "from the center of the square. Each bug has a new pending diagonal. This transformation will repeat, \n",
    "each time with the bugs moving closer to the center. Since the bug paths are mathematically ideal\n",
    "the bugs will cross the diagonals an infinite number of time while traveling a finite distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More on the infinities\n",
    "\n",
    "As the bugs continue to spiral inward the infinite succession of pending diagonals become infinitely close together, what a relief: Both the travel time and the distance to the center are finite. If we unravel that path into a straight line and mark the locations of the diagonals that are crossed in succession, we will have no problem fitting an infinite number of such locations on our finite line segment which, after all, includes an infinite set of points from which to choose.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Solution by plausible argument: The four bug locations $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are always arranged in a perfect square where the side of the square reduces in length from 1 meter at the start to zero at the center. Furthermore at any instantaneous moment in time each bug is walking precisely along the edge of that square. If I am bug $A$ then every step I take moves me that much closer to bug $B$. Since bug $B$ is traveling at right angles to my direction of travel: Bug $B$'s motion does not increase nor does it decrease my distance to bug $B$. That is: Even though my path is curving I am always reducing my distance to $B$ by the steps I take. Since I began one meter from bug $B$ I must walk 1 meter to meet her. Therefore 1 meter is the total distance traveled by each bug. $\\boxdot$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symmetry note\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem features a square that shrinks in size but remains a square. If you imagine being one of the four pursuers/pursuees and starting off on your journey you can see yourself making even just a very little headway as your path begins to curve inwards. At this point you and your three friend bugs are still at the vertices of a square. You are still facing along the edges of that square. And so you are starting the problem over on a slightly smaller square. \n",

    "From this we can infer one or two additional things: The spiral pathway itself must also scale downwards. That is, you could rescale it and rotate it and it would fit on top of itself. Furthermore if you have traveled through some angle $\\theta$ with respect to the center of the square, you can expect to have another angle $\\theta$ to go before you reach... the corner of a new smaller square. And from there yet again, and again, and again. In other words the spiral pathway passes through an unbounded number of diagonals of the original square, or if you like an infinite number of degrees of angle. (cf Zeno's paradox) \n",

    "Since the (constant) velocity of the pursuit does not matter, let's set it equal to one so that time and distance are related by equality. Hence distance traveled $d$ is equal to time elapsed $t$. This removes time and velocity from the problem since they don't have any impact on the answer anyway.\n",

    "\n",
    "The original square of side length $S$ puts the pursuers at radial distance $R=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}S$ from the center of the square. Each step of length $\\delta$ brings the pursuer a distance $dr=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\delta$ closer to the origin (simple geometric argument based on the square of pursuit). After the pursuer has traveled a distance $d$ it therefore has a radial distance from the center of $r=R-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}d=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}(S-d)$. The ratio of current radial distance to original radial distance (the closing ratio) would then be $\\frac{S-d}{S}$. Now let's just calculate that value of $d_D$ for a cumulative change in heading of $\\pi/2$ radians, when our pursuer crosses over that next diagonal.   \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "I take an infinite number of infinitesimals frame of mind to this problem. So the problem breaks down into \"What happens during an individual tiny step?\" and then \"How do all the steps sum up?\" The individual step is always in a straight line towards where the target was at the beginning of the step; and then after the step is done the car pivots a little bit in preparation for the next tiny step. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does the pivot action cost me any distance? Well if my steps become small enough then my pivots will also be very small; but again there are a huge number of pivots. But it does not sound like a pivot involves covering ground; so I will say from the outset that the little pivots do not contributte to the sum of my total distance travelled. This simplifies the tiny step part of the problem. I will also point out that after each car's step-and-then-pivot: The figure has the same shape as before with slightly smaller dimensions; so the geometric shape does not change as the various cars or points converge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose I take a step $dx$. How much closer or further away am I from my target? When my target is headed away from me... provided he did not go as far in the radial distance ($dx$) as I did: I ought to be closer. So far so good because he goes $dx$ but not directly away from me. If there are only two cars in fact we are $2\\cdot dx$ closer. If there are three cars then he went towards the third car and moved in towards me a bit of his own volition; so I get more than $dx$ closer. For the square, with four cars, he went at right angles to my direction of travel so I am $dx$ closer. And if we have five or more cars then he is traveling around a pentagon / hexagon / etcetera obliquely away from me; so I do not make $dx$ worth of progress towards him. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key idea towards getting the solution for $n$ cars. My distance along the line of sight to him in one step is $dx$. If I subtract from this his distance traveled away from me as projected on the radial line from me to him I arrive at a closure distance per step. I can then take our initial distance apart, $a$, and divide it by this closure distance. That gives me the number of steps it takes to cover that initial distance $a$. And for each of these steps I actually moved $dx$. So I multiply number-of-steps times $dx$ and that is the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the projection distance I need the interior angle for a regular n-gon, and this is given in the first equation above. The projection involves the cosine of this angle, and carrying out the arithmetic the $dx$s cancel and we have the result shown for $s$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Final reflections\n",
    "The result of taking $n$ to be $0$ or $1$ is not very instructive; but neither does the problem make sense. Happily if we take two cars facing each other the distance they travel is $a/2$ which has to be right! \n",
    "\n",
    "For $n = 3$ we are in an equilateral triangle and the distance I travel is two thirds of $a$. That seems reasonable... particularly since for $n = 4$ we travel a distance $a$: The motion of our object of pursuit is always at right angles to the line of sight and (while it makes for an interesting pattern) does not modify the distance we travel along the side of the square to reach the collision. For larger values of $n$ we must go further and further, as the target is moving obliquely away in pursuit of his target; and so the solution given above seems quite reasonable. \n",
    "\n",
    "My favorite aspect of this result is when we allow the number of sides of the regular polygon to go to $\\infty$. Now, true, we have a circle of infinite size; but look what happens to the solution. The interior angle goes to $\\pi$ radians and the necessary distance traveled is $\\infty$. That is, my target is always moving directly away from me at the same speed, so I never reach him. In fact in Euclidean space we are on a circle of infinite radius which is the same thing as a straight line. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a ''next'' version of the problem: Place $n$ points in arbitrary locations on the plane. Let's stipulate that they all move at the same speed (where again they are pursuing one another in a cyclic fashion). What happens?  One imagines that they might collide near the center of mass of the distribution. In fact from here on out I worked first from a computer program to draw what happens over time, keeping in mind that my finite steps could lead to solutions that are incorrect!\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another version of the problem: As previously place $n$ points at random on the plane but permit their speeds to vary as the distance to their intended target. The result is both interesting and pretty to watch; it suggests a couple ideas for how to go about a mathematical solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution in question is how far each vertex travels in the course of collapsing the figure which we expect will contain loops given enough vertices. \n",
    "\n",
    "And further: What happens when points are placed in a 3D space? Regularly or at random; or in $K$ dimensions?\n",
    " \n",
    "Suppose we begin with bugs (chiroptera, say) that can fly in three dimensions. $8$ of them on a cube? Other regular polyhedra? \n",

    "I will refer to these \"multiplied sums\" as two sum-products, the first for cosine squared and the second for sine squared. The end result will also be an infinite-degree polynomial; but notice that on multiplying out the two sum-products, both on the left and the right, the results will feature only even powers of x. Furthermore choosing a particular power of x, say degree '''n''' (where '''n''' is an even number greater than or equal to zero) we have two cases to think about for the coefficient of <big>'''<math>x^{n}</math>'''</big>. When '''n = 0''' only the cosine sum-product will contribute, and it will contribute exactly '''1'''. The sine sum-product only starts contributing for '''n = 2, 4, 6, 8, ...''', i.e. '''n is an even integer greater than zero'''. Of course the cosine sum-product contributes for these values of '''n''' as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, for '''n-even > 0''' we can write out what the cosine sum-product and the sine sum-product terms will conribute to the coefficient of '''<big><math>x^{n}</math></big>'''. Specifically when '''2i + 2j = n''' then the cosine-squared sum-product contributes (left side of the above) and when '''(2i + 1) + (2j + 1) = n''' the sine-squared product contributes (right side). In what follows, then, we can reduce those four sums to a single sum and (by expressing '''j''' in terms of '''i''' and '''n''') collapse the complicated products into something manageable. We now consider the resulting coefficient for some particular value of '''n''', that is for the coefficient of '''<big><math>x^n</math></big>''' in the resulting infinite-degree polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For some '''n''', and for cosine squared we are concerned only with '''i = 0, 1, 2, ..., n/2''' which in turn determines what '''j''' must be: '''j = n/2 - i'''. For sine squared we are concerned with '''i = 0, 1, 2, ..., (n/2)-1''', and correspondingly '''j = n/2 - i - 1'''.  So concentrating on a particular power '''n''' in the polynomial we can desist from writing '''j''' since we have it in terms of '''i''' and '''n'''. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in comparing these two sums over '''i''' values we see that the cosine-squared part has an extra i-value, namely '''i = n/2''' that is not present in the sine-squared sum over values of '''i'''; so we will carry that extra calculation out separately after everything else.  \n",

    "### Eye Color Problem Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Book 1 Chapter 13 provides a challenging logic problem, courtesy of Randall Munroe, about an island of people who\n",
    "do not know the color of their own eyes. Adam has bravely dived into this problem; we present here the outline of \n",
    "a solution that touches on the notion of proof by induction: Start out with a pattern that can build upon itself\n",
    "and notice the strange but logically consistent end-results. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes on the Eye Color problem \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will approach this problem by taking a common tactic: We will try and solve an obvious and much simpler\n",
    "problem first. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that instead of 201 people on the island there are only three people: One with blue eyes, one with brown\n",
    "eyes, and the guru with green eyes. What happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us modify the problem in the direction we want to go. Suppose there are\n",
    "five people on the island: One guru (with green eyes), two people with \n",
    "blue eyes and two people with brown eyes: What happens? Think about these two\n",
    "cases before reading further. See if you can arrive\n",
    "at a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Three people solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The guru sees someone with blue eyes. The person with blue eyes realizes 'oh... the other people\n",
    "do not have blue eyes; it must be me!' and they get on the boat that very night. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Five people solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now two people have blue eyes. Five total: So add in the guru and two people with brown eyes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us call the two islanders with blue eyes A and B. They are both present when the Guru says 'I see a person with\n",
    "blue eyes.' Now up to this point A could not say to B 'You have blue eyes' because this is not allowed. But the Guru \n",
    "simply said something that both A and B know is true, that there is someone on the island with blue eyes.  Although\n",
    "notice: They only know that the other person has blue eyes; they still do not know their own eye color. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now A reasons as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'If I have blue eyes then I must leave on the boat at midnight. But B has blue eyes so the Guru could have been \n",
    "referring to B, not to me. Therefore I do not know my own eye color for sure. Therefore I will not leave on the \n",
    "boat tonight.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B reasons exactly the same way; and both A and B wake up the next morning, having slept the night through still\n",
    "unsure of their eye color. They see one another... neither has left the island. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now A, upon waking up and seeing that B did not leave last night, reasons further as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'The only way that B could still be here is if I have blue eyes. For if I did *not* have blue eyes then B would \n",
    "have two pieces of information that would force him to leave on the boat last night: He could see that nobody else \n",
    "on the island had blue eyes simply by looking around; and he knew yesterday that there was at least one person on \n",
    "the island with blue eyes. Since the only person on the island whose eye color he does not know is his own: He would\n",
    "conclude that he must have blue eyes. Therefore he would have left on the boat last night, according to the rules. \n",
    "But he did not leave on the boat. Therefore he must not have been sure that he had blue eyes last night. Therefore \n",
    "there is at least one other person on the island with blue eyes. The only person that this could be is me because I \n",
    "can see that nobody else on the island has blue eyes. Therefore I have blue eyes. Therefore tonight\n",
    "(since I now know my eye color is blue) I must get on the boat and leave.' \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next morning both A and B are gone. Both reached the same conclusion and left on the boat. So in this case: \n",
    "After two days two people have left the island: Both of them being the people with blue eyes. Did you come up \n",
    "with a solution that agrees?  A very important question at this point is: Does it matter if instead of two \n",
    "people with brown eyes there are three? Or nine? Or 23?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have solved the case of five people on the island let's increase the number to seven! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seven people problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the island there is one green-eyed guru plus three people with brown eyes and three people with blue eyes. \n",
    "Same question: Who leaves, and when? You might try following a similar line of reasoning as above and see how \n",
    "it turns out. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Seven people solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call the people with blue eyes A, B, and C. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first day, when the Guru says 'I see a person with blue eyes' there is some careful thought. Again we \n",
    "imagine what A would say to himself:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'Of course there is a person with blue eyes. B and C both have blue eyes. Regardless of my eye color (which might\n",
    "be blue) the island has two people for sure with blue eyes. Of course neither one of them can be sure of their own\n",
    "eye color. I know for example that when there are two people on the island with blue eyes they both leave after \n",
    "two days because on the first day they are not sure of their own eye color. I will predict that \n",
    "both B and C will still be here in the morning; but on the second day they will both be gone.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first night passes and A wakes up. Sure enough: B and C are both still there. The day passes and everyone \n",
    "goes to sleep in the evening. On the second morning A wakes up and is surprised to see that B and C are both still \n",
    "there. They did not leave on the boat! A now reasons as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'The only way B and C would be gone this morning is if they both saw only one other person on the island with \n",
    "blue eyes.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That is: If only B and C had blue eyes it would just be the previous problem where there were five people on the island, \n",
    "two with blue eyes, where those two leave after two days. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A continues his thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'I was expecting B and C to leave on the second day. It occurs to me now that this was based on the assumption that\n",
    "my eyes are not blue. The only way they could have stayed the second night is if they were in the same situation as \n",
    "me: They both saw two other people with blue eyes. That is: Just as I saw two other people with blue eyes, so did \n",
    "B and C. That could happen only if I also have blue eyes. Therefore I have blue eyes... time to leave.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So reasons A; and B; and C. On the third morning: A, B and C were all three of them gone from the island. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the number of brown-eyed or green-eyed people does not matter. What matters is only the number of blue-eyed \n",
    "people. The island could have 1000 people with only two of them blue-eyed: And both of those people would be gone two days\n",
    "after the guru makes her comment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The original problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you convince yourself that on an island with four people with blue eyes: All four leave on the fourth day? \n",
    "If there are 100 blue-eyed people on the island then is it really true that all 100 of them leave on\n",
    "the boat 100 days after the guru makes her comment about seeing a person with blue eyes? It seems rather absurd \n",
    "when you look at it from this 'end result' point of view: People sitting around for days and days and weeks and\n",
    "months and then suddenly voom! Everyone with blue eyes gets on the boat!\n",
    "\n",

    "The book is also inspired by the National Research Council book _How People Learn_ which indicates that without a context web it is well nigh impossible to build an understanding of a subject. To put this another way: Some students, a small fraction, have the innate quality of initiative. They build context webs under their own power and they can sail through books by Martin Gardner having the time of their life.

    "I would like to provide a practical anecdote from my own experience. This has happened to me many many times: I read through a book on mathematics, I find a particular problem, and I set to work. The problem involves perhaps a myriad of possible solutions and I begin following up a particular idea. This turns into some algebra and suddenly I am expanding infinite sums of polynomials simply writing out line after line of symbols like an automaton; only to run aground on the shores of the Mare Insolvus. (need the proper Latin here; ask David Beck) (this sea goes on the map) Then I sit back and realize that the original author posed the problem precisely because there is an Aha solution… so I finally allow myself to relax and think about that. And within a few minutes the solution appears. This happened for the Gardner problem concerning the worm going through the 3 x 3 x 3 cube. I could tell the problem could be represented as a path through a graph but I became caught up in drawing the \n",

Was the loss due to experiences in previous games, one game per week? Perhaps. But more important might be what happened in practice two nights per week over the season. But no: What really mattered was what did or did not happen every single day. Did the players go outside in their backyard or on the sidewalk and practice dribbling the ball? Shooting against the side of a building? Passing back and forth for hours with a friend? Sprinting down to the corner of the block, resting for ten seconds, and doing it again… and again… and again… until that became easier… and then going two blocks. In short: Repetitions help solidify our skills. The road through the mathematics landscape that is the school curriculum is full of repetitions. There is no substitute for 99.99% of us for doing hundreds or thousands of algebra problems. If you write down x you should automatically know you could also write that as $\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{x}}$.  \n",

    "Miss Halfaway never finishes what she sets out to do. One day she decides to walk from Zero to One on the real number line. But after setting out she gets as far as 1/2 and decides to go no further. Looking back she decides to return to Zero but again only makes it halfway, stopping at 1/4. She turns around again and decides to go back to 1/2. But you guessed it: She only makes it half way and stops at 3/8. By continuously reversing direction and proceeding in this manner she eventually arrives at a particular location on the real number line. Where does she end up? What does it mean to 'arrive at a specific location' by making an infinite number of progressively shorter journeys? \n",

    "This problem is both about *itself* and about mathematical idealization. You may be tempted to introduce real-world considerations like 'how long does it take her to make an infinite number of trips?' or 'how does she get small enough to travel on the real number line?' Please write those down, crumple up the paper and toss it into the trash. These problems require you to abandon practical thinking, and this is one of the many freedoms of mathematics. When you\n",

    "fireplace, and she had some kittens to play with. In short she had it made. But there was a large mirror\n",
    "or as they say 'looking glass' above the mantle of the fireplace; and in this mirror she could see a \n",
    "reflection of the room that she was in. And being a persistently curious child... which is quite common \n",

    "Alice conveniently ignored the reflection of herself as she gazed into the looking glass. Instead she \n",

    "there a fire burning in the other room as well? Would the books on those shelves contain the same \n",
    "stories or different ones? And so pondering she eventually climbed up on the mantlepiece and stepped\n",
    "through the looking glass and into the other room to find out. (The glass had become tenuous like \n",
    "mist.) As she proceeded to explore she was very gratified to find that some of her guesses were \n",
