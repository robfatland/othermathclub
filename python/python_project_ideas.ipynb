    "# Building Units From Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Seven Suggested Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Unit is conceived as perhaps four hours of effort with some breaks thrown in. It is intended to introduce ideas \n",
    "and code-based exploration. Here is the outline for Unit building.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To search for (and hopefully find) an **Idea** for the unit: Rely on your experiences and your sense of what is fun!\n",
    "- Create a **Path** from 'nothing' to an end result related to your Idea\n",
    "- **Interpolate** this Path: Map out the smaller steps in between\n",
    "- Break up the learning Path into segments, one for each session, with **Milestones**\n",
    "    - At the end of that day you can summarize 'Here is the milestone we have reached...'\n",
    "- Call out Python **terminology** in your procedure (Remember the \"17 elements of Python\")\n",
    "    - Here we need to remember how many stones in each pile.\n",
    "    - \"We use *variables* called `pile1`, `pile2`, `pile3`.\"\n",
    "- Have a **colleague** test and give you feedback on your Unit. \n",
    "    - More than one colleague: Even better.\n",
    "- Write out the **Narrative** of your process as a reference\n",
    "    - Having it written out helps reinforce the main points you want to touch upon\n",
    "    - The Narrative also helps set expectations for the students as they follow along your Unit Path\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "## When In Practice Running The Unit\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always be positive\n",
    "- Normalize (encourage) questions\n",
    "- Uncertain Questions are very valuable so value them\n",
    "- Keep everyone together, take your time, go slower than you think you should\n",
    "- Build in breaks every 25 minutes for 5 minutes\n",
    "- If you can: Build in some sort of away-from-the-computer activity\n",
    "    - It does not need to be related to the Unit!\n",
    "- Use `input()` to model the difference between User and Coder\n",
    "- Periodically touch back on the **Idea**\n",
    "- Be prepared to be flexible; change your paln; improvise\n",

    "It introduces the mechanical idea of alternation using `% 2` on a counting value.\n",
