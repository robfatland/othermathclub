    "The word **and** in 'first place *and* second place' translates to **multiply**. \n",
    "The number of possible first-place animal choices is multiplied by the number of \n",
    "remaining second-place animal choices. This is counting possibilities without \n",
    "knowing which animal actually came in first or second.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these $20$ possibilities for first and second place, there are still three other\n",
    "animals remaining in the race. Those animals will come in third, fourth and fifth place. \n",
    "Consider third place: There are $3$ possible third place animals. Total possible outcomes\n",
    "of the race so far is $5\\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 60$. Now two animals remain, so there are \n",
    "two possibilities for fourth place. Total possible outcomes is \n",
    "$5\\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 120$. Only one animal remains; so it will come in fifth. \n",
    "Total possible outcomes is $5\\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 120$. This is\n",

    "for a race with five animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combination example\n",
    "\n",
    "The word *combination* means counting subsets. Above we saw how to calculate a \n",
    "combination from two numbers. Let's now see how this correctly counts subsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A set contains ***a*** distinct elements; so let's use an example of ***a*** books on a shelf\n",
    "where there is only one copy of each book. We want to investigate the number of ways\n",
    "of taking a subset of ***b*** books down from the shelf. The claim is that this\n",
    "number of subsets is equal to the combination $\\binom{a}{b}$. Here is the \n",
    "combination function again as a calculation, a ratio of three factorials:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\binom{a}{b} = \\frac{a!}{b! \\cdot (a-b)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with easy cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How many ways are there of selecting *all* of the ***a*** books down from the shelf? \n",
    "There is just one way since we do not \n",
    "care about the order of the selected books. The combination function works properly\n",
    "in this case because $\\binom{a}{a} = 1$. Similarly there is only one way to select\n",
    "none of the books, leaving them all on the shelf: $\\binom{a}{0} = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How many ways are there to select exactly one book from a shelf of ***a*** books? The \n",
    "answer is ***a*** and again the combination $\\binom{a}{1}$ gives the correct\n",
    "result ***a***. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How many ways are there to select all but one book from a shelf of ***a*** books? Each\n",
    "possible selection of ***a-1*** books will leave one book remaining on the shelf.\n",
    "As there are ***a*** ways of leaving just one of ***a*** books on the shelf, again the combination \n",
    "is correct: $\\binom{a}{a-1} = a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider selecting 2 books from ***a*** books. The claim is that this should be\n",
    "$\\binom{a}{2}$. Here is a rationale for why this is so. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are ***a*** ways of selecting a first book. The ***a-1*** books remain on the shelf. So\n",
    "there are ***a-1*** ways of selecting a second book. The total number of ways of selecting\n",
    "both a first and a second book is therefore $a \\cdot (a-1)$. This is a sort of \n",
    "shortened version of ***a*** factorial. We can write this as the fraction \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{a!}{(a-2)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator factorial conveniently cancels out most of the numerator factorial \n",
    "leaving only $a \\cdot (a-1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is good so far, but we have one additional detail to\n",
    "consider. Let's suppose we choose a subset of two books from the\n",
    "***a*** books on the shelf. This choice is one of the possible subsets\n",
    "among our $a \\cdot (a-1)$ possibilities for 2-book subsets. In this\n",
    "case suppose our first title is ***Through The Looking Glass*** and our second\n",
    "title is ***The Wind In The Willows***. We put these two books back on the shelf\n",
    "and do the selection a second time. That is, we select two books from\n",
    "the ***a*** books on the shelf again as a first and then a second selection.\n",
    "This time suppose that our first title is ***The Wind In The Willows*** and \n",
    "our second title is ***Through The Looking Glass***. This is the same\n",
    "subset as before, selected in a different *order*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The detail is: We do not have any order to the books in our subsets.\n",
    "This means that the above calculation $a \\cdot (a-1)$\n",
    "counting subsets will count a single subset as two separate subsets. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Subset { ***The Wind In The Willows***, ***Through The Looking Glass*** } is the \n",
    "same as subset { ***Through The Looking Glass***, ***The Wind In The Willows*** }.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All possible two-book subsets are double-counted when we use $a \\cdot (a-1)$. \n",
    "This is twice the correct result: \n",
    "$\\frac{a \\cdot (a-1)}{2}$, and that matches the combination result:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$2-book \\; subsets \\; of \\; a \\; books \\; = \\; \\frac{a!}{2! \\cdot (a-2)!} \\; = \\; \\binom{a}{2} $$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the same argument for three-book subsets from the shelf of ***a*** books. \n",
    "This time the calculation \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a \\cdot (a-1) \\cdot (a-2) \\; = \\; \\frac{a!}{(a-3)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "will over-count the number\n",
    "of subsets by a factor of six, which is $3!$. This means we introduce a $3!$ in \n",
    "the denominator to fix the over-counting and again the combination is correct. \n",
    "The conclusion is that combinations correctly count subsets by first \n",
    "compounding the number of ways they can be selected and then dividing out \n",
    "multiple counts of the same subset, since subset element order does not matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$b-element \\; subsets \\; from \\; a\\; set(size\\; = \\; a) \\; = \\; \\frac{a!}{b! \\cdot (a-b)!} \\; = \\; \\binom{a}{b} $$.\n"
