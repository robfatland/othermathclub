    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next question: What is the probability that a given dart is in the circle?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So here is a calculation. We throw $D$ darts and count how many of them land \n",
    "inside the circle. Let's call that number $C$. Then the ratio of darts-in-circle\n",
