## Chapter 1 version 1

'Oh no!' Claire looked aghast at the slowly spreading ink stains on her jeans pocket. Out came the pen, uncapped, 
much too late to stem the inky tide, out came a disembodied pen cap, and then it was tears welling.

'Well... at least you're not racist.' This came from Caleb, across the aisle of the bus. Caleb with the incredible 
ability to be inappropriate, the world's genius of the stupidest possible remark. Claire's face transformed into a 
mask of scorn. Then contempt. Then what she felt was a pretty good disgust. That sequence complete she turned away 
and felt again the horror of the ruined pants. Somewhere in the back of her thoughts came a phrase from one of her
mother's podcasts. It had struck her as strange and now it resurfaced... 'certain varieties of rapid-cycling
psychotics'. And with that she resigned, sighed, summoned the Distractor, stared blankly through the bus window
unseeing as the city blurred past.


## Chapter 1 version 2

'Suppose you go fishing...'

Mr. Lent was clearly on the ramp up the roller coaster. Claire began to feel queasy.

'So your friend drops you off with your fishing pole and your plan is to take the bus home.'

His voice was gathering momentum. There was no other way to describe it. She could hear the creaks of chairs as
the other students leaned forward. She leaned backward.

'And you fish for a while but you don't catch anything... so now it is time to take the bus back home, see? And 
your fishing pole is five feet long. But it is old and brittle and doesn't bend much. So the bus comes, right? 
The door opens, you start to get on, but the bus driver stops you. He says 'Hold on there!' He says you can't 
board the bus with anything larger than three feet in dimension.'

Claire began to wonder where this was going in spite of herself. But at the word 'dimension' she realized this 
would never do... enough is enough thank you... and so with no effort at all she summoned the Distractor and
lapsed into the state of total Disawareness. Mr. Lent vanished. The floors, chair, ceiling, lights, the class 
room all vanished. The desk was gone. All that remained was a hair tie on her wrist that she quietly twisted.
Today's lunch menu? Pizza? Pizza or mac and cheese. The roller coaster rumbled off into the distance.

## Chapter 1 version 3

'Did you feed... no, I'm sorry, I mean: *Thank you* for feeding the dog.'

'Oh shoot!' (only it wasn't 'shoot') as she stood up and rushed the refrigerator.

'You don't need to say that. "Shoot" will do just as well.'

'*You* say it.' 

'Yes I do, I do; and you may say it as well; but only... only when...'

But she was already clattering down the stairs, dog food in hand.
