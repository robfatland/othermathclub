    "One fine day a pirate who has been attending a party feels tired and returns to the harbor to fall asleep in her hammock on board her boat. \n",
    "She heads towards the wharf. Her boat is tied up at the far end. (A wharf goes out from shore and boats tie up to it.) This wharf is 7 steps \n",

    "stumbles to the left or to the right: You see the problem! She will tumble off the side of the wharf into the cold water. (There are no\n",
    "other boats tied to this wharf at the moment you see.) What is the probability she makes it safely to her ship if she starts at the center \n",
    "of the wharf? Again the wharf is 7 steps wide... so she starts at step 4. If she takes four steps and each time stumbles one step to the \n",

    "This story is a bit like our drunken pirate described above... except nobody is going to fall into the harbor. It concerns an artist named Egon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Egon is a painter and a poet. He lives in the beautiful town of Monte Carlo by the sea. In the center of this town is the town square, a large flat brick plaza. \n",
    "Egon wishes to paint something on the town square but he does not know what... until one day he finds a discarded dice. He discovers that when he rolls it\n",
    "the top face comes up either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. But he finds that he cannot reliably predict what that number will be. This gives him an idea for a painting. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Early one morning Egon sets three empty paint cans A, B and C on the ground to make a huge triangle in the town square\n",
    "* He walks to some random location on the town square where he can see his three paint cans forming the corners of a large triangle, 137 feet to each side\n",
    "    * The 137 feet is not important here; it is just for our amusement\n",
    "* Egon rolls his dice.\n",
    "    * On a 1 or a 2 he walks half way to paint can A\n",
    "    * On a 3 or a 4 he walks half way to paint can B\n",
    "    * On a 5 or a 6 he walks half way to paint can C\n",
    "    * He then paints a dot on the ground at his feet\n",
    "* From that new spot: Egon repeats the process: \n",
    "    * He rolls the dice\n",
    "    * He uses the same method to select a destination paint can\n",
    "    * He walks half way to that paint can \n",
    "    * He paints a dot\n",
    "\n",
    "If Egon repeats the process 17 times he will have 17 dots. But he does not stop at 17. He keeps on going and going and going, rolling, walking half way, \n",
