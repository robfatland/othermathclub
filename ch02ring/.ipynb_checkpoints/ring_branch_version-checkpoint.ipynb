    "# A ring problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem concerns a circular ring of integers. (This is *not* a 'ring' \n",
    "in the sense of an algebraic structure that generalizes fields; it is a\n",
    "literal ring of numbers.) A solution is given but it\n",
    "is incomplete as of July 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A finite set of integers summing to $1$ is written down in some order to form a ring; \n",
    "so these integers have a circular order but the ring has no special position.\n",
    "A 'flip' is repeatedly applied to the ring as follows: \n",
    "If the ring includes a negative number $-a < 0$ it can *flip* to value $a\\;>\\;0$. \n",
    "This adds $2a$ to the ring sum; so the ring sum $1$ is maintained \n",
