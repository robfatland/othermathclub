## Introduction

The purpose of this page is to introduce an inverted pyramid of mathematical process.

## There is a hypothesis

...in social science that language determines thought. It may be a little circular since habits and customs are arguably tied
to language and these may in turn reflect necessities in thought patterns. 

Be that as it may let's take the idea a step past language to mathematics. We can admire the precision of mathematics
and thereby say 'the more i speak in terms of math the more precise my thinking'. This is a normative statement so it
might be best to begin with a few axioms.

* Mathematics is taken to be the exploration and discovery of patterns through imagination and reason.
