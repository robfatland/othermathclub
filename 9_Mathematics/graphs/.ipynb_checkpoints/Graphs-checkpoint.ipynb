    "For a cycle visiting four of the five vertices: One vertex is always left out. Hence \n",
    "there are five such choices of four vertices. Let's call one of these $\\{ A, B, C, D \\}$. \n",
    "A cycle can be written as $ABCD$ since we know that $D$ connects back to $A$ to complete the \n",

    "However notice that $ABCD$ and $ADCB$ represent the same cycle traversed in opposite directions; \n",
    "which again we take to be the same cycle. To avoid double-counting in this way we divide \n",
    "by two to get three possible cycles for a given choice of four vertices. Therefore since \n",
    "there are five such choices with three distinct cycles each: There are 15 4-cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we have the Hamiltonian cycles that touch all five vertices. There is only one \n",

    "careful not to double-count the reverse direction cycle? Let's always choose $A$ as the \n",

    "be true if they happen to include a Hamiltonian circuit. Going in there is an important idea that you may wish to\n",
    "convince yourself of; and then there follows some reasoning to a result; and from there we look at a set of problems\n",
    "that use this result. In exploring the problems we find a collection of *useful ideas* that are consequences of \n",
    "the result. It is a bit like someone handing you a hand tool that you have never seen before... and as you begin\n",
    "trying to use it you find it has many more uses than you originally imagined. Maybe it is a Swiss army knife... \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Grinberg was apparently a mathematician who made this discovery; and Kozyrev helped publish it; so together it was called\n",
    "the Kozyrev-Gringberg result. I will abbreviate this KGT for **Kozyrev-Grinberg Theorem**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now bear in mind we are combining the rule 'this is only about planar graphs' with the idea 'suppose a graph has a \n",
    "Hamiltonian circuit'. There are many graphs that are non-planar; and these graphs can have Hamiltonian circuits. But\n",
    "we stick with planar graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a planar graph that has a Hamiltonian circuit. (At least one; so if more than one: Pick one of them.)\n",
    "Now imagine we have drawn this graph on a piece of paper in blue ink; and we highlight the Hamiltonian circuit with \n",
    "red ink. I will abbreviate Hamiltonian circuit as HC from now on. So we have a graph drawn in blue with a red circuit\n",
    "highlighting a path that closes back upon itself and visits every vertex of the graph once. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "kilroy figure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in this example the HC winds around in a squiggly way but there are no edge crossings. \n",
    "Imagine that we start deforming this\n",
    "drawing of the graph by expanding it outward -- like blowing up a balloon -- so that the HC can expand outward in shape\n",
    "\n",
    "kilroy figure\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it has reached a point where the red HC is convex all the way around; approximately a circle. We did not have \n",
    "to take this step but it helps illustrate how we will think about the graph next. The edges of the graph that are not\n",
    "part of the HC are either inside the HC or outside the HC; and the crucial thing is that they still do not cross one \n",
    "another. We still have the same planar graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are convinced that this transformation is perfectly legal without changing anything fundamental about the graph \n",
    "then we are ready to begin. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take the total number of vertices in our planar graph $G$ to be $n$. All $n$ vertices are contained in \n",
    "the HC which we will call $C$. They are contained in $C$ because this is the definitiong of a Hamiltonian circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that edges of the graph that are not part of $C$ are either inside of or outside of $C$ and that they carve up\n",
    "the space into regions which are simply faces of the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside of $C$ let us imagine that there are $d$ edges. $d$ could be as small as zero or as large as ... well you can\n",
    "think about this. Certainly $d$ could be larger than $n$. But for some definite graph there is a definite value of $d$ \n",
    "for us to make use of. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us remove all of the $d$ internal edges and count the total number of faces inside $C$ as we put them back one by one.\n",
    "With all of them gone there is one internal face inside $C$. Put back one of the edges: The number of faces is 2. Put\n",
    "back a second edge: The number of faces is 3. Put back all $d$ edges and the number of internal faces is $d+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far so good; and our next step will be to put these $d+1$ regions (faces) into some buckets. Adding up how many \n",
    "faces are in the various buckets will add up to $d+1$. To do this we first make a little side-note: A planar\n",
    "graph may have multiple edges between two vertices; and it may also have loop-edges that connect a vertex to itself. \n",
    "Let's agree to not allow our planar graph to have loops; although multiple edges between two vertices are ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to these buckets: If a face is defined by two edges it goes in the $2$ bucket. If it is defined by three edges\n",
    "it goes in the $3$ bucket. If it has $12$ edges around it it goes in the $12$ bucket. Once all the faces including \n",
    "the everything-else-face are placed in these buckets we count how many faces are in each. The number of faces in\n",
    "the three bucket we call $f_3$. There are no faces with one edge because we do not allow loops. So there is an $f_2$\n",
    "which is how many faces have two edges, and there is $f_3$ and $f_4$ and so on. Since there are $n$ vertices \n",
    "the largest possible bucket is the $n$ bucket which would have a count of $f_n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of all the $f$ values must be the number of regions inside $C$ (the Hamiltonian circuit) which we have \n",
    "noticed must be $d+1$. In notation this is \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum^{n}_{i\\;=\\;2}f_i \\;=\\; d\\;+\\;1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice this starts with $i$ (the number of sides of an *i-gon*) being $2$ and runs as high as $i=n$. Some of \n",
    "the $f_i$ values may very well be zero. For example if the graph has 20 vertices but there are no 17-gons then\n",
    "we have $f_{17}=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's multiply the number of edges $i$ by the count $f_i$ and add these up. This is a way of counting edges \n",
    "because if there are 6 4-gons on the inside of $C$ then $i = 4$ and $f_4 = 6$ and there are a total of $24$ edges\n",
    "involved. Immediately you will notice that the $d$ interior edges inside of $C$ are counted twice in this way; \n",
    "but the edges of $C$ are only counted once; and there are $n$ of these. Therefore we have\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum^{n}_{i\\;=\\;2}i\\;\\cdot\\;f_i \\;=\\; n\\;+\\;2\\;d$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we have two sums, both of which are true for the inside of $C$. Since we have two equations involving\n",
    "the number of inside-edges $d$ we can combine them to eliminate $d$ from our result. The reason for this is \n",
    "because we want to think about the various faces (*n-gons*) of the graph without knowing in advance what the \n",
    "Hamiltonian circuit is. In fact we are building a tool to determine whether or not there *is* a Hamiltonian \n",
    "circuit so knowing about $d$ (edges inside of $C$) would mean that we already know $C$ so we would have our \n",
    "answer at the start. So let's get rid of $d$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d\\; = \\; \\sum^{n}_{i\\;=\\;2}f_i \\;-\\;1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "therefore \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum^{n}_{i\\;=\\;2}i\\;\\cdot\\;f_i \\;=\\; n\\;+\\;2\\;\\cdot\\;(\\sum^{n}_{i\\;=\\;2}f_i \\;-\\;1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "and we can combine the two sums since $i$ runs over the same indices like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum^{n}_{i\\;=\\;2}(i\\;-\\;2)\\;\\cdot\\;f_i \\;=\\; n\\;-\\;2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can follow the same line of reasoning for the extra edges outside of $C$. The results are the same but of course\n",
    "the various buckets will have different values; so let's call those $f'$ to distinguish them from $f$ which were \n",
    "the bucket counts on the *inside* of $C$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum^{n}_{i\\;=\\;2}(i\\;-\\;2)\\;\\cdot\\;f'_i \\;=\\; n\\;-\\;2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both of these sums are equal to $n-2$ we can set them equal to one another; or we can subtract one from\n",
    "the other to get zero (since they equal the same thing): \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
