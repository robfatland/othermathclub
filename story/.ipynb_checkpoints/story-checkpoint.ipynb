    "The time had come for Kid Pipkin's birthday party; and seeing as how she was turning 18\n",
    "this was considered a momentous event; a Long Expected Party of great importance; \n",
    "and so everyone took extra special care to travel there and to arrive on time, even some\n",
    "she had not heard from in quite awhile. Of course the celebration was at Fyz Byzkyn's \n",
    "farmhouse; and as it was to be quite an event Kid Pipkin showed up an hour early to help \n",
    "with preparations. \n",
    "\n",
    "'Oh I'm so glad you came early' said Fyz Byzkyn. 'The horses have not been watered yet and today\n",
    "they happen to need precisely seven gallons of water.' \n",
    "\n",
    "Kid Pipkin arrived at the watering trough but found only a nine and a five gallong container. ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back in she said 'Your horses seemed in very good spirits, Kitty particularly.' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Yes' said Fyz Byzkyn, 'I got them some hay fresh in from the fields... and I think they \n",
    "have worked out how to nibble blackberries at the fence now they have come in, July has just \n",
    "flown by.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a knock at the door, and Kid Pipkin went to welcome... who would it be? In fact it proved to\n",
    "be Alibasi, recently escaped and on the loose yet again, sporting a lovely pair of diamond earings, \n",
    "and up further the drive walked Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz and Zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba, hand in hand,\n",
    "who had stepped away from their easels at the beach to celebrate the occasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon they were joined by George Dyson, and both Curious George and the Man with the Yellow Hat.\n",
    "The Man With The Yellow hat does not speak in this story, for as was his custom he was present\n",
    "to try and protect Curious George from harm, and Curious George will not be at any risk except\n",
    "perhaps a sugar overdose. But that is peeking ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not far behind them came Horst Borskin. Surveying the \n",
    "gathered throng, Kid Pipkin thought to herself how familiar and how beloved they all were, \n",
    "that while years had passed it seemed to have not had the slightest impact: Everyone \n",
    "was chatting and laughing as if they were picking up from conversations this morning or \n",
    "just the day before. \n",
    "\n",
    "The doorbell rang again and at last it was the girl with the skirt of many different colors, \n",
    "all of them really shades of orange, and finally\n",
    "behind her Put Bunkin (whose real name was Bisaella, and whose *real* real name was Isabella) \n",
    "carrying a large box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon they sat down to dinner, prepared by Fyz Byzkyn in a flurry of smoke and odors both mysterious\n",
    "and slightly burnt. First he brought out the birthday cake with 18 lit candles, and according to \n",
    "custom they all sang Happy Birthday (though Zyxwvutsr sang it backwards) before she made a wish\n",
    "and blew them out. The cake proved to be a Backwards Cake with three \n",
    "very thick layers made of frosting separated by thin slivers of cake, and with more cake \n",
    "formed in a cylinder about the perimeter and a disc of cake covering the top. Fyz Byzkyn seemed so pleased with \n",
    "his invention that nobody bothered to mention that a cake made mostly of frosting was a bit on the \n",
    "rich side. And Curious George didn't mind anyway. \n",
    "After cake was finished it was time for the main course (crab and brussels sprouts apparently), \n",
    "and then finally a salad and at last appetizers which all seemed to feature pesto.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is much like the Backwards Dinners we used to get in the Army\" observed Horst Borskyn.\n",
    "As usual nobody had any idea what Horst Borskyn was talking about so they merely nodded and\n",
    "looked thoughtful. Then after a minute had gone by a gleam of triumph appeared in Fyz Byzkyn's eyes.\n",
    "\"Oh ho\" he began joyfully, \"it is not *like* a Backwards Dinner Horst Borskyn,\n",
    "it ***is***\" (and here he drew out the word 'is' for about eight seconds) \"...a Backwards Dinner. And now I\n",
    "should like to ask, How did you enjoy it Kid Pipkin??\"\n",
    "\n",
    "'Well of course it was ever so much the most splendid birthday dinner I've ever had, and the best you \n",
    "have ever cooked!' she responded with a grand \n",
    "smile spreading across her face, but then just as suddenly her countenance fell.  Everyone grew quiet \n",
    "and she said in a small voice 'I wish we could begin with this dinner and keep going backwards in time\n",
    "just, ever so quickly, to the days when\n",
    "I met you all, all so many years ago, so that we might go out upon our adventures all over again.'\n",
    "And she began leaking great tears from here eyes. Nobody spoke but they all stood and gathered about her and \n",
    "created a group hug the biggest any of them could remember, and there was a great deal of sniffling and \n",
    "wiping of faces and noses amongst the assembly. "

    "(and there was some polite chuckling) '...but perhaps we can tell stories, and remind ourselves of \n",
    "some of those adventures. So I will go first...' and she began by recalling the vast chasm\n",
    "within the high vaulted peaks of the Sierra Nevada mountains, but she reminded them that she \n",

    "\n",
    "'...and was this part of the great pursuit of the two wizards?' asked Horst Borskyn. The two\n",
    "wizards in question looked down at the floor in slight embarrassment. They had been the quietest \n",

    "our stories could end that way, with making new friends that once were enemies.' \n",
    "\n",
    "There was a pause as everyone had a little think, and then the girl with the multicolored skirt\n",
    "(who had also been fairly quiet to this point) spoke up. 'I seem to recall there was a time \n",
    "when we had to negotiate with a terrible sea monster who was grabbing passing ships... but \n",
    "the memory is so distant now... I remember it had built a castle on the sea floor...' \n",
    "\n",
    "'Oh indeed' said George Dyson 'and that was when we discovered that you lived with and even\n",

    "\n",
    "'Megaptera Novaeangliae as I recall' said Put Bunkin.\n",

    "unusual native habitats? I mean, just consider for example that George lives in a strange treehouse\n",

    "off as she considered whether it was polite to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "'...in prison' Alibasi finished for her, with a big smile. 'That's true and I count myself\n",
    "among the former foes now in the friends category. I am proud to say Kid Pipkin that you were responsible for\n",
    "my arrest and conviction at least three times, which I do respect. As I was breaking out of\n",
    "prison yesterday (to attend this party) I found myself wishing it was a little more difficult\n",
    "these days. With all the practice I have had it has just become about as difficult as shopping\n",
    "for groceries. Plus now that I'm out again I will have\n",

    "have a spare room for rent? I can pay in cash or diamond, as you like.'\n",

    "'Yes' said Fyz Byzkyn (though it sounded more like 'Yus') 'You can stay in the guest room for \n",

    "\n",
    "The room lapsed into general chit chat for some time until Put spoke up again (she seemed to have\n",

    "you been up to lately?' \n",
    "\n",
    "There was a quiet pause as Kid Pipkin seemed to consider, and then she spoke. 'Well as you know\n",

    "to sail to the moon. And the way to do that is: You know how the moon sets on the ocean and sometimes \n",
    "there is a kind of a \n",
    "mirage where the bottom of the moon's circumference flips over and the effect is a kind of \n",
    "an Omega shape?' (Those who knew what an omega looks like now pictured this.) \n",
    "So one day I was thinking about this but not in terms of\n",
    "planets moving about and orbital mechanics and atmospheric lenses, \n",
    "but instead I found myself thinking in an abstract way about calculus on manifolds, \n",
    "and I realized (I *think*) that for a couple of moments in the course of the moon setting I could \n",
    "navigate across that mirage in my sailboat,\n",
    "but only if I made a branch cut across time, and this would bring me to the moon but not\n",

    "safety, a plan to get out of trouble when things go wrong in your adventure. That is me; and I will\n",
