### Overview: Games with graphics


We describe (under the **Coils** project) creating simple games where the human plays one side and your Python program plays
the other. Here we will add some graphics to the process to make your games more visually interesting, as in the above 
tic tac toe board. To review: Here are five game challenges of increasing difficulty (no graphics necessary) to get started:


* Guess a number from 1 to 100: Computer is the Chooser and responds **higher** / **lower** / **got it!**
* Guess a number from 1 to 100: Computer is the Guesser and you (the player) are the Chooser
* Nim: Set a pile of stones; the program and the human take turns removing 1 to 3 stones; the last one to remove a stone loses
* Nim: Same as above but with three piles, for example with 9, 11, 13 stones

### Adding Graphics


The easiest way of creating a simple visual game that I know of uses the 'pygame' package. In order to
use it (via **import**) you will need a Python environment and you will need to have pygame installed.
See the PythonBytes coaches for help with this. 


Once you have that in place: Create a program that shows the board for the game you have in mind and
allows the player to make moves. In my example program (example.py) the game is tic tac toe.


### Details


As you work on building a game you will probably find out that all sorts of things can go wrong that
you didn't realize when you started out. Persevere!
