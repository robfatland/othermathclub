    "### Overview of Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall begin with our old friend Ms. Halfway and conclude with \n",
    "an algebraic derivation of a limit. \n",
    "We work from the idea that a *convincing argument* or *informal proof*\n",
    "is what we are looking for. \n",
    "\n",
    "A sub-theme of this page is the notion of infinity (symbol $\\infty$). There \n",
    "are a number of expressions and sequences that go on *forever* which might first appear to be a problem: \n",
    "Who has that much time? By working with them we hope to show that mathematics has ways of reducing them\n",
    "to finite results in short order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is $R$ for arbitrary $G(a,b)$?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Read on to find out what this means!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some background material before we start\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need some background information including 'What is the factorial function?'. \n",
    "Let's cover that first. After we do so the next remarks set up the main problem for this\n",
    "page, which is to solve for a number $R$ that we will define in terms of two source \n",
    "numbers $a$ and $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factorials\n",
    "\n",
    "The *factorial* function is used in combinatorics, the math of counting. By example: '3 factorial' \n",
    "is written $3!$ and is equal to $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 = 6$. Similarly $4! = 24$ and $5! = 120$. \n",
    "For peculiar reasons we must agree that $0! = 1$. I do not justify that; I just assert it without \n",
    "proof for the time being.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalizing the Fibonacci sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Any two real numbers $a$ and $b$ can be used to generate an infinite sequence of numbers\n",
    "via addition: $g_0 = a$, $g_1=b$, $g_2=g_0+g_1$, $g_3=g_1+g_2$, and so on. If you begin with\n",
    "$a=0$ and $b=1$ you get the Fibonacci sequence $F$. To put it the other way around:\n",
    "We can say that the general case of Fibonacci\n",
    "starts with two arbitrary numbers $a$ and $b$. We can call that sequence $G(a,b)$ and write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G(a,b)\\;=\\;a,\\;b,\\;a+b,\\;b+a+b,\\;a+b+b+a+b,\\;\\cdots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G(0,1)\\;= \\;F \\;=\\;0,\\;1,\\;1,\\;2,\\;3,\\;5,\\;\\cdots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G(-4,9)\\;=\\;-4,\\;9,\\;5,\\;14,\\;19,\\;\\cdots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ratios of successive terms in $G(a,b)$\n",
    "\n",
    "From a sequence like the one above we can form ratios of successive terms. For \n",
    "example you might say that $r_1=g_1/g_0$, $r_2=g_2/g_1$ and $r_n=g_n/g_{n-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "These values (the r-ratios) can be calculated for any successive pair of numbers\n",
    "in the sequence. However notice: While the numbers in the sequence may possibly\n",
    "get larger and larger without bound we have not yet determined what happens to\n",
    "the values of the r-ratios. That is the central problem of this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limits of such ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of a limit can be expressed in different ways. Here we will ask 'Does the\n",
    "successive term ratio $r_n$ as defined above settle down to a fixed value - called a *limit* -\n",
    "as $n$ goes to infinity?\n",
    "\n",
    "It might be worth going over that last question a few times to be sure it is clear.\n",
    "We are letting the subscript $n$ head off to infinity. That is like trying to calculate\n",
    "the largest number in the Fibonacci sequence: It can't be done. But we can certainly\n",
    "*imagine* calculating larger and larger numbers for quite some time. Hence we can\n",
    "look back at ourselves and say\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"As a finite creature this person could not calculate something that continues on for\n",
    "infinity... but this person can certainly *imagine* going on towards infinity: They\n",
    "attached it to a counting process using the number $n$.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have looked back upon ourselves let us return to our problem. \n",
    "We shall label the possible limit for the ratio $r_n$ as the capital letter $R$. \n",
    "We could call it $R_G$ to associate it with a general sequence $G(a,b)$. \n",
    "We could call it $R_{a,b}$ also; \n",
    "but let us simply call it $R$.\n",
    "The limit $R$ - if it exists - implies that $r_n$ can get as close \n",
    "to $R$ as we like by making $n$ large enough. \n",
    "In other words, as $n$ gets larger and \n",
    "larger the ratio g_{n}/g_{n-1} gets closer and closer to $R$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stating this more formally: Pick a tiny positive \n",
    "number $\\epsilon$, as close to zero as you like (but it must be positive, not zero). \n",
    "Then there is some $n$ (which may be very large) for which $r_n$ is less than \n",
    "$\\epsilon$ away from $R$. We write\n",
    "\n",
    "$|r_n-R|<\\epsilon$ for sufficiently large $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is $R$?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The $R$ limit for the Fibonacci sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Fibonacci sequence $G(0,1)$ the claim is that this limiting ratio $R$ is $\\phi$, the golden ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R=\\phi=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proving $A=b$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an idea that may look rather trivial but it is useful in the solution given below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wish to show that a complicated expression $A$ is equal to a simple number $b$ (not zero). \n",
    "Certainly\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = b \\cdot \\frac{A}{b} = b \\cdot C$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can show $C = 1$ we have shown that $A = b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Polynomials\n",
    "\n",
    "Algebra often involves polynomial expressions. In school we tend to work with real numbers and \n",
    "ask the question 'for what value or values of $x$ is the following polynomial equal to zero?' These\n",
    "values of $x$ are called roots of the equation $f(x) \\; = \\; 0$. For example\n",
    "$x+7=0$ has one root $x=-7$ and $x^2-1=0$ has 2 roots $x=1$ and $x=-1$. \n",
    "How many roots do you suppose there are for the following equation?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$3x^7-2x^6-5x^5+2x^4-8x^3-3x^2+9x-5=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you guessed '7' you are absolutely right. But you get extra credit if you also know that we need\n",
    "to expand our definition of numbers in order to find these roots. If we are constrained to only using\n",
    "real numbers then roots may be hard or impossible to find. So here I am making two assertions without\n",
    "proof: First that a polynomial of degree $n$ has $n$ roots and second that the real numbers have\n",
    "a limitation: They can not always provide us with these roots. The roots lie elsewhere 'in another\n",
    "landscape' and we are at the moment blocked from that landscape by a rockslide... if you'll pardon\n",
    "the metaphor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearing the landslide requires expansion of the real numbers\n",
    "to a new more complicated type of numbers, in fact called complex numbers.\n",
    "Complex numbers are written as pairs of real numbers like so: $(a, b)$. We don't need these numbers\n",
    "in this Algebra Part 1 notebook; I just wanted to mention that they exist and that the real numbers \n",
    "are a subset of the complex numbers. In fact real numbers are just complex numbers for which\n",
    "the second number $b$ is zero ($b=0$). So the real number $7$ is\n",
    "the same as the complex number $(7, 0)$. Complex numbers are\n",
    "useful and are introduced in Algebra Part 2.  "

    "#### Proof by induction\n",
    "\n",
    "What is 'proof by induction'? A good definition would take some time... so I will provide a quick not-so-good\n",
    "definition. Suppose you want to prove some **thing** that is abstract -- a mathematical idea -- \n",
    "that uses the symbol $n$ to represent a positive integer. You want to prove the **thing** is true \n",
    "for all values of $n$ that are, suppose, integers greater than or equal to $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example suppose you want to prove that all integers $n>1$ are perfect squares. (They are obviously not; so\n",
    "I am choosing a bad example; but this doesn't matter because we won't actually try to prove this. We have\n",
    "a proper induction proof given below.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Induction proofs often proceed as follows: First you assume that the thing you want to prove in general \n",
    "(abstractly) is completely *true* for a definite value of $n$.  You show that if it is true for $n$ then \n",
    "it is also true for $n+1$. You do not say what $n$ is at this point. Rather you are assuming some abstract \n",
    "$n$ 'works' for the **thing** and show this means the **thing** also works for $n+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to repeat the process: If it is true for $n+1$ from $n$ then by extension it will be \n",
    "true for $n+2$ from $n+1$ as follows: You say 'Let $m = n+1$ and use the same argument as before to show \n",
    "it is now true for $m+1$.' Same argument, just using a different symbol $m$ instead of $n$. Of course \n",
    "$m+1$ is really $n+2$ and thus you can proceed upwards: Given the **thing** works for $n$ then it works\n",
    "for $n+1$, $n+2$, $n+3$, $n+4$, $n+5$, ... andso on as far as you like. \n",
    "In this manner there is a bit of countable infinity built into your proof... but you escape from having\n",
    "to prove the **thing** is true an infinite number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally you find some precise value of $n$ for which the **thing** can be shown to be true. Say you show\n",
    "it is true for $2$; and now you have shown it is true for all values $n >= 2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### An induction proof is needed here\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's prove that ... kilroy ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The quadratic formula\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the quadratic formula? We use this below to solve for the golden ratio value $\\phi$. The quadratic\n",
    "formula states that if you have a function of a variable of the form $\\alpha x^2 + \\beta x + \\gamma$ then\n",
    "there are two possible values of $x$ for which this formula produces the result **Zero**. These values of\n",
    "$x$ are called roots. Sometimes the\n",
    "two roots may be identical... so really there is only one root (or you can say that the two roots \n",

    "numbers which we have not yet introduced... and in fact we could even permit $x$ to be a complex\n",
    "number... which we have not yet introduced... so there is some complexity involved in the quadratic formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However the formula itself is easy enough to remember. It is a staple of algebra courses everywhere! Notice the\n",
    "two roots differ in formula only by a sign:\n",

    "\n",
    "The above proof for $F$ does not show that $p/q$ tends towards $\\phi$ *directly*. Instead it does a double-step: First that $p/q$ tends towards the positive root of $x^2-x-1=0$, and second this root is $x_1=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ which we call $\\phi$. There might well be a more direct solution. In fact if you agree with my thinking there *must* be\n",
    "a more direct solution because... well because I have a bias that way. The double-step solution is not pretty enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This comment refers to subjects beyond what we are discussing here so it does not hurt to skip.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a result in probability called the Central Limit Theorem that states that -- no matter what the probability distribution for a random variable -- if you add enough of those things together, assuming they are independent of one another, you wind up with a new probability distribution that is Gaussian. It is a curious thing that situations that appear to have unique shapes or starting conditions can gradually converge to a predictable end-result that is independent of that initial state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also interesting: The binomial distribution can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution and the terms of the Fibonacci sequence can be written as sums of binomial coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 5: $R$ for $G$\n",
    "\n",
    "$F$ is our Fibonacci sequence $0,1,1,2,3,5,8,...$ and $G(a,b)$ is our generalized Fibonacci sequence $a,b,a+b,a+b+b,a+b+a+b+b,...$ The former is a special case of the latter: $F=G(0,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could now argue for $R$ for $G$ as we did for $F$, simply using successive terms in $G$ this time. \n",
    "Call them $s$ and $t$ with implicit indices $i$ and $i+1$: \n",
    "We evaluate ${\\left( \\frac{t}{s} \\right)}^2 - \\frac{t}{s} - 1$ and take the limit of large $i$. \n",
    "The numerator will again be a fixed number independent of the index $i$, not necessarily $1$ \n",
    "as for $F$ but rather taking on a value dependent on $a$ and $b$, the starting or *seed* values \n",
    "of $G$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we do this then as before he denominator will become larger as the index $i$ gets larger\n",

    "with very little extra work we find that $R=\\phi$ works for *any* $G$, not just $F$. \n",
    "This result might be a little bit surprising. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could state this result the other way around as well: Since $R=\\phi$ for *all* $G$ it\n",
    "must apply to $F$, a special case of $G$ ($F=G(0,1)$). \n",
    "\n",
    "'$R=\\phi$ for $G(a,b)$' is indeed the answer; but I will give a different version of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We noticed earlier in writing out $G(a,b)$ as $g_0, g_1, g_2, \\cdots$ that $g_i = \\alpha \\cdot a + \\beta \\cdot b$ \n",

    "We can call these values $p$ and $q$ respectively as we did above. \n",

    "Here is the idea for this solution: Let's form the ratio for successive terms of $G$ and pull out \n",
    "factors of $q/p$. Then we take the limiting case where $i$ becomes very large in order to\n",
    "substitute $\\phi$ for $\\frac{q}{p}$. And then we shall see where that leaves us. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Our strategy is to use the earlier result for $F$ that $p/q$\n",
    "tends to $\\phi$ in the limit of large term index $i$.*\n",
    "\n",
    "From $G(a,b)$ we write the successive term ratio for some term index $i$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{g_{i+1}}{g_i}=\\frac{qa+(p+q)b}{pa+qb}=\\frac{q}{p}\\left( \\frac{a+\\frac{p}{q}b+b}{a+\\frac{q}{p}b} \\right)$$\n",
