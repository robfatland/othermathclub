    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Context, paraphrasing from Wikipedia: Electronegativity is a *tendency* to attract or accept shared electrons \n",
    "when forming chemical bonds. Electronegativity is affected by both atomic number (in terms\n",
    "of which column of the periodic table, i.e. valence electron count) and the radial distance\n",
    "of the atomic (or molecular?) valence electrons. Higher electronegativity: stronger electron\n",
    "attraction. Electronegativity relates to bond energy. A chemical bond has a strength -- the\n",
    "energy needed to break the bond -- and this strength is related to the shared versus separated\n",
    "nature of the distribution of electrons. At the shared end of the spectrum we have covalent bonds\n",
    "and when the electrons are separated we have ionic bonds. The term electropositivity is an\n",
    "opposite of electronegativity: it characterizes an element's tendency to donate valence electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the functional result of all this electronegativity context: First, the right-hand column\n",
    "of the periodic table is noble gasses that have all their outer shells filled so they are not in\n",
    "the bonding business. Ignoring the right-most column: Electronegativity increases from left to right\n",
    "in the periodic table in the column sense; and electronegativity increases from higher to lower \n",
    "energy levels, i.e. in the periodic table row sense. As a consequence, the most electronegative \n",
    "atom is ...drumroll please... Fluorine. This acts as the origin for electronegativity. \n",
    "If we are two chose the *least* electronegative atom: It will be the one *furthest* from Fluorine on \n",
    "the periodic table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### The Five Rules of Lewis structures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules are the *basic set*. There are advanced rules; but I will kick that can down the road for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Draw the individual atoms with their dots (this is optional... 'know your actors')\n",
    "    - ...then follow the rules below on a clean slate\n",
    "1. Find the total number of valence electrons for a given molecule.\n",
    "    - For water we should get 8 valence electrons: 6 from oxygen and one each from the hydrogens\n",
    "    - For a negative ion we have an atom or molecule carrying additional charge\n",
    "        - Example: $CN^-$: 4 valence electrons for Carbon, 5 for Nitrogen, 1 for the ionic charge: 10 total\n",
    "2. Establish the \"center\" atom of the Lewis structure\n",
    "    - For 2-atom molecules there is no center\n",
    "    - For three or more atoms there is a center\n",
    "        - Place the least electronegative atom at the center\n",
    "        - Place the other atoms on the outside\n",
    "        - Caveat rule: Hydrogen is a special animal\n",
    "            - Hydrogen is always placed on the outside of a Lewis structure\n",
    "        - Example: $P\\;Cl_3$ will have a phosphorous atom at the center (check this)\n",
    "3. From this arrangement of atoms: Put 2 electrons between atoms to make covalent $\\sigma$ bonds\n",
    "    - Simple example: $H\\;Cl$ has 8 valence electrons (Hydrogen: 1, Chlorine: 7)\n",
    "        - It has two atoms so there is no center\n",
    "        - Place the first two valence electrons like **H:Cl** to make the $\\sigma$ bond\n",
    "            - Not now but at the conclusion: Re-draw each two dot bond ':' as a dash '-'\n",
    "    - We are working from a valence electron budget of 8 so 6 remain\n",
    "4. Complete the \"8 electron\" octets: First for the outside atoms, then for the center atom \n",
    "    - Hydrogen doesn't have an octet. Its outer shell can carry 2 electrons.\n",
    "        - In the above **H:Cl** example Hydrogen has 2 from the covalent bond: All set\n",
    "        - The Chlorine gets the remaining 6 electrons as 3 lone pairs: 8 total: All set\n",
    "        - We are done with the HCl structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    ..\n",
    "H - Cl :\n",
    "    ..\n",
    "```\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "5. If the central atom does not have an octet: Move electrons from outer atoms to form double or triple bonds\n",
    "    - This happens when we run out of valence electrons without filling the octets\n",
    "        - There could be the alternative issue of too *many* remaining electrons\n",
    "    - Simple example: $O_2$\n",
    "        - This is two Oxygen atoms, same electronegativity, 12 total valence electrons\n",
    "        - No center\n",
    "        - One $\\sigma$ bond (2 electrons: 10 remaining)\n",
    "        - Complete the octet for one Oxygen (6 electrons: 4 remaining)\n",
    "        - Try to complete the octet for the second Oxygen (4 electrons: 0 remaining)\n",
    "        - Now the second oxygen is 6 out of 8 octet electrons and rule 5 applies\n",
    "        - Move two electrons from the first Oxygen to create another valence bond\n",
    "            - So this would be a first $\\pi$ bond\n",
    "            - Using dots we have **O::O**. Using lines we have **O=O**.  \n",
    "        - Now the octets are full for both Oxygen atoms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a more complicated example let's consider Sulfur dioxide, $SO_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- 18 valence electrons\n",
    "- Sulfur is farther from Fluorine than Oxygen so it goes in the center\n",
    "- Covalent bonds (Rule 3) use 4 electrons, produce O:S:O, 14 valence electrons remain\n",
    "- 6 electrons to each Oxygen to complete outer octets and 2 electrons remain\n",
    "    - The sulfur atom has 4 electrons in the two $\\sigma$ bonds\n",
    "    - Add the 2 remaining valence electrons to sulfur for a total of 6\n",
    "    - Asymmetric steal: Choose the left oxygen and move two electrons to the sulfur bond\n",
    "        - This is now a double ($\\pi$) bond and we have O::S:O\n",
    "        - The sulfur now has a completed octet, as do the two oxygens\n",
