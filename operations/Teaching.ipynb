    "## Sequencing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is \"sequencing\"? By this I mean presenting information for a lab or lesson in\n",
    "a very deliberate way. We want to keep students' interest, not leave them behind, \n",
    "give them rewarding tasks, and challenge them in a way that they find fun. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I present an example lesson. My purpose is to consider how we manage information \n",
    "as we teach, the *sequence* of touch points. The lesson involves a circular dartboard \n",
    "set into a square frame. The idea is to use random numbers to calculate the value of \n",
    "$\\large \\pi$. Here is how this works: The dartboard has a radius of one. One what? \n",
    "One meter? One foot? One dartboard? Doesn't matter but let's say \"one dartboard radius\".\n",
    "The square frame has dimension \"two dartboard radii by two dartboard radii\". So we \n",
    "can draw this on paper as a unit circle framed by a 2 x 2 square. So far so good. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need to throw a random dart. This will hit the dartboard at location $(x, y)$\n",
    "and here we have a complication. The Python `random()` method produces a number\n",
    "on $[0, 1]$ so we can use that to put the dart in the upper right quadrant of the\n",
    "square. We can also take that random number, multiply it by two and subtract one. \n",
    "Now it has a value on $[-1, 1]$. This stays consistent with the statement of the\n",
    "problem but it requires time to understand. For now let's stay with that. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From here let's take the fast but ineffective (confusing) approach: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a zero counter and a loop\n",
    "    - Set `x, y = random(), random()` as the coordinate of a dart\n",
    "    - If the distance to `(x, y)` from the origin is less than one: increment the counter\n",
    "- Calculate a ratio: Counter value divided by the number of darts thrown\n",
    "- The area of the unit circle is $\\large \\pi$ and the area of the square frame is 4\n",
    "    - Therefore this ratio should be about $pi/4$\n",
    "- Multiply the ratio by 4 to get an estimate of $\\large \\pi$\n",
    "- Wooooooo!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is wrong with this? From personal experience it commits the grave error \n",
    "of going through the concepts too quickly. A good rule of thumb is: Any time\n",
    "two ideas are presented in sequence, like $A$ then $B$: That is too fast. In \n",
    "this case the two ideas are \"$A$: The area of the circle is $\\large \\pi$\" \n",
    "and \"$B$: The ratio of the two integers is a ratio of the two areas.\" \n",
    "In fact there is even a third idea hidden in here: \"$C$: Every dart throw\n",
    "lands in either one area or both areas.\" And this in turn depends on the idea\n",
    "that the two areas overlap. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So ok, this is too fast; so let's take another try at the activity in outline form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will do some mathematical reasoning so here is an easy start\n",
    "    - Suppose I think of a number and say \"That number divided by 4 is 2\"\n",
    "    - Another example: \"My number divided by four is 10\"\n",
    "    - What are you doing to arrive at my number?\n",
    "        - Perhaps you don't even think about it\n",
    "        - If you do you realize you are reversing what I tell you\n",
    "            - The reverse of \"divided by\" is \"multiply by\"\n",
    "            - \"divided by 4\" is reversed by \"multiply by 4\"\n",
    "    - We are going to learn how to translate this into computer code\n",
    "        - We are \"invested\" in the code working properly\n",
    "        - We will always do simple tests to be sure this is so\n",
    "- Now let's start our program with `from random import random` and `from math import sqrt`\n",
    "    - Let's print some values of both methods to become familiar with them\n",
    "    - `random()` we use right away\n",
    "    - `sqrt(9)` we use later on\n",
    "- `x = random()` produces a number on $[0, 1]$ and then `print(x)`\n",
    "    - By putting the random value in `x` we preserve it for later use\n",
    "    - Let's practice transforms...\n",
    "        - ...until we understand what `x = random()*4 + 3` does\n",
    "        - Start with `x = random()*2`\n",
    "        - Then try `x = random() + 5`\n",
    "        - Then combine them\n",
    "    - Once we have this sorted we will expand our randomness to `x` and `y`\n",
    "- Imagine the 2 x 2 square centered on the origin\n",
    "    - Let's construct $(x, y)$ as random points on this square\n",
    "    - Notice this is enabled by the previous step\n",
    "- Now let's set up a loop to run `nDarts = 100` times\n",
    "- Above the loop let's set up `nHits = 0`\n",
    "- Inside the loop let's test each dart throw. \n",
    "    - A hit is if the dart lands on the right side of the board\n",
    "    - What are the chances of this? \n",
    "- Now that our program runs: What do our two numbers nDarts and nHits tell us?\n",
    "    - And from this: How do we get those two numbers to tell us the result?\n",
    "- Now we have a way of calculating $1/2$ using random numbers. Celebrate!\n",
    "    - What is the probability of hitting the upper right quadrant?\n",
    "    - How do we code this?\n",
    "- How about we draw a diagonal line through the origin\n",
    "    - How to code it? What is the result? \n",
    "    - Emphasis: We are using reasoning to check that our code works\n",
    "- Now let's draw $(x, y)$ on the diagram with \"legs\" and \"hypotenuse\"\n",
    "    - How far is this point from the origin?\n",
    "- What is the shape of the region where all points are less than 1/2?\n",
    "    - How about 3/4? \n",
    "    - How about all points closer than 1?\n",
    "    - Notice this is the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin\n",
    "    - This is called the unit circle\n",
    "    - What is its radius?\n",
    "    - What is the formula for the area of a circle?\n",
    "    - What is the area of the unit circle?\n",
    "- How can we test $(x, y)$ to see if it is inside the unit circle?\n",
    "    - Notice `sqrt()` is not strictly necessary\n",
    "- Now set our `nHits` counter to increment if the dart hits the circular dart board\n",
    "- What is the area of the dartboard? Of the square? Of their ratio?\n",
    "- What can we do at the end of the program to see our experimental value of $\\large \\pi$?\n",
    "    - If necessary: Remind \"I am thinking of a number that, when divided by 4, equals 7.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a long gradual  road to the result, written as a script. The experiment is \n",
    "to run through this script with some students to see if it \"works\" as a lesson. \n",
    "By slowing things down and working with multiple areas we start to make it second\n",

    "### Call And Response Teaching\n",
    "\n",
    "We want teaching to be interactive; and this means often asking a question or giving a\n",
    "directive and getting back an answer or an action. Let's call this call-response teaching, \n",
    "in contrast to lecturing or transmit-receive teaching. The big picture goal is this: We \n",
    "inhabit a complex and wonderful 'next world' whereas the students are in a less complex,\n",
    "less wonderful 'this world'... and we are train conductors helping them travel across.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The number one counterproductive inclination we tend to have as teachers is to \n",
    "'push the point' with our students. What do I mean by this?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ask a question and then -- when the student does not respond -- provide the answer ourselves.\n",
    "* When the student delays in answering: Rush to add a leading question.\n",
    "* Tell a student what code to type in.\n",
    "* Pull the laptop over and write or edit code for the student.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushing the point is *intervening* in the student's learning process before it completes.\n",
    "To be sure: Sometimes 'completes' does not mean 'arrives at the correct answer'. \n",
    "Let's articulate some completions in the learning process; in response to a question or\n",
    "a task that we provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The student knows the answer and provides it directly.\n",
    "* The student provides a partially incorrect answer.\n",
    "* The student struggles and eventually provides the answer.\n",
    "* The student answers confidently but incorrectly.\n",
    "* The student struggles to an incorrect answer.\n",
    "* The student is unable to arrive at an answer.\n",
    "* The student provides some related information that they feel more solid on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously we want the environment to be supportive. We establish early on and keep reinforcing that\n",
    "\"I don't know\" is a great answer. We rehearse with the students saying \"I am not sure but I know that...\"\n",
    "where they can state something they believe is relevant. These rules of response allow the student \n",
    "to complete the call-response process without the teacher providing an intervention. It is very \n",
    "hard not to intervene when we feel a sense of urgency. This is the \n",
    "second element of call-response, once we have established \"I don't know\" as a welcome answer. \n",
    "This second element is patience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An absurd example: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Teacher: Alright Phil, what is Planck's constant? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Phil: <pause> I do not know but I think it has something to do with pirates...\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    \n",

    "progress (challenge the students; they grow) with successful call-response experiences\n",
    " (reinforce the material through articulation). \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here are some approaches to following up incorrect responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- First: Go for an affirmative (see below *)\n",
    "- Second: Chart a new course\n",
    "    - The incorrect response is an indication that the material is not internalized yet\n",
    "    - Maybe the question needs to be re-stated\n",
    "    - Maybe the premise material needs to be repeated\n",
    "    - Maybe the next steps in the plan need to be altered / supplemented\n",
    "    - Maybe it is time for a break\n",
    "    - Maybe it is time for students to work together\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The counterpoint to 'patience' is 'repetition'.  It is very easy to view something we \n",
    "understand as easily understood by someone else. It is never a crime to tell a student\n",
    "something they already know. It validates and reinforces their understanding. Only when\n",
    "this happens to excess without checking in with the students on their level of engagement\n",
    "does the repetition process risk losing their attention. Again it is a balancing act.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "The main point of this little essay is that patience and repetition are our most important\n",
    "skills to develop as teachers. This is difficult because we tend to teach things we find\n",
    "exciting and novel. We teach from the *next* world in the hope of sharing that world with\n",
    "the students living in *this* world. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Affirmative: Some type of encouraging, positive response that genuinely communicates to \n",
    "the student that their participation in call-response was the important thing, not whether\n",
    "they got the right answer. Often (for an incorrect response) the affirmative will pull out\n",
    "some word, phrase or concept in the incorrect response and emphasize it because it is \n",
