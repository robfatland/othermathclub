    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Variant idea\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A negative\n",
    "value could be chosen from the ring and some double increment added to it, say $2e$ whereupon $e$ \n",
    "would then be subtracted\n",
    "from both neighbors to keep the sum constant. Even more generally: $e$ (finite positive)\n",
    "might vary from one move to another. I thought about this as a possible means of making the \n",
    "problem easier to solve but it did not help.\n",

    "find a compensatory positive balance?' \n",
    "* An interesting thing happens (resembling a CA) when only one negative \n",
    "value remains in $R_n$.\n",
    "Suppose for example the ring is as shown below where $n\\;=\\;20$. \n",
    "There is only one number available to flip: producing a shifted 7  -7 pair;\n",
    "and then again to shift another step and so on: A traveling wave \n",
    "that propagates to the right around the ring. As the numerical values \n",
    "found in the ring do not change during propagation this suggests that\n",
    "any metric (if it is to be monotonic) should somehow incorporate a type of 'ring distance'. \n",
