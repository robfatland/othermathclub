    "necessary to just push and fight your way through stuck-ness. One way of doing that is to know that there is some\n",
    "sort of *Aha!* built into the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile another theme we have is to not simply solve a problem and move on. Rather we hope to be able to dig\n",

    "A train departs from Chicago heading towards Peoria 100 miles away. It travels at a constant speed of 25 miles per hour. A second train departs from Peoria towards Chicago on the same track at the same time at the same speed. Uh oh... it seems that they will eventually crash into one another. Meanwhile a little bee who can fly very quickly flies back and forth between the two trains along the track. She flies at 150 miles per hour. She begins this back-and-forth flight path just as the two trains start off. Now the two trains will eventually collide but happily they are automated trains with nobody on board so nobody gets hurt. At the last instant the bee flies upwards so she is not hurt either. Whew. But the question is: Between the trains starting off and colliding how far does the little bee fly? "
