    "Egon is a painter and a poet. He lives in the beautiful town of Monte Carlo. He one day finds a die in his beard (the little cube with the pips on each face you use in games like Yahtse).  Egon starts rolling numbers from one to six, noticing that each number comes up with equal probability. Egon imagines a random procedure for using the die to paint a gigantic triangle on the town square (or as they say in Monte Carlo, the piazza). And so on the piazza he places three cans of paint A, B and C on the ground as markers -- far apart from one another -- to define the corners of triangle ABC. He walks to a fourth location somewhere near triangle ABC. There he begins his procedure: \n",
