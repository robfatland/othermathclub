## Skill tiers


The Python Bytes (non-competitive) computing club has run each year at Tyee
Middle School in Bellevue Washington from 2018 onward. Until last year (the 2023-24 
school year) the club placed students into two 'tiers': Tier 1 was intended to 
serve students who were completely new to coding and tier 2 was oriented towards 
students who already had some coding experience. 


In this most recent year the distinction was abandoned because it tended to 
dilute our limited teaching resources. It also broke up friends (which they
do not enjoy) and it deprived the tier 1 students of potential help in
learning the material from their peers. The new assumption for 2023 was 
that all students who join the club are essentially beginning coders. 
This helps in the club's shift to a focus on ideas, described below.

## Language


We learn a languages on multiple levels; and let's suppose we are 
motivated by some need to communicate so all those levels come together.
Python as a programming language follows this pattern; so the challenge in
the club is to combine motivating ideas with a process of learning the 
basics, the mechanics of coding. Do this with a limited club time of 
75 minutes per week.


Let's assume that details of Python syntax will be picked up by the 
students along the way. We are now free to shift emphasis to ideas and ask:
What are some ideas that produce a good learning experience? 
One such idea is the story of Ms. Halfway.
The Ms. Halfway problem ('Where does she wind up?') has three great 
features. First we can act it out in the classroom. 
Second it can be solved mathematically. And third it can be simulated using
a small amount of Python code.


## Teaching approach


### Part 1 Start with ideas


As noted above we hope to begin with ideas that have nothing to do with
computers or `print` statements. From there we want to dream up
exploratory ideas that translate to calculation. Then and only
then, thirdly, we open our computers and begin writing code.


Once the code works we can solve the problem. However in the spirit of
exploration this is intended as a rewarding starting point. Is our code
able to help us explore other questions? Other ideas?


### Part 2 Methods


Middle school students do not (with some exceptions) have the perseverence 
to simply learn `print` and `while` in a vacuum. Here are some approaches to 
leading the process.


- code along: Instructor writes code on the whiteboard, student copies.
Explanations as we go. Good to get started and get a working result.
Does not get the students self-sufficient
- Solve it: The guide presents a problem to solve via code.
This might be a many-steps / iterative process. Interactively go over
relevant commands. Students work together or individually. Here the idea
is to provide minimal intervention; so working on self-sufficiency.
- Socratic: Instructor chooses a student, asks them a high-level question.
Example: After introducing Ms. Halfway ask "Where does she end up?"
Assuming the student is not sure of the answer: We resort to small leading
questions directed to this student and to other students. By means of these
small steps we eventually arrive at a plan for code that solves the problem.
Very important: No coding until the algorithm is understood.
- Kinesthetic: Activities away from the computer that enact some part of
a source idea. These work well if there is some motion involved and if there
is an opportunity to reach a non-obvious conclusion.


### Part 3 Pedagogy

Python syntax can be deconstructed into (let us say) 20 sub-topics.
These can be organized into a learning sequence. Elements of the 
sequence are then presented and internalized. As an example starting
point we want to begin with *flow* (statements and order of execution),
*information* (variables and data structures) and *bugs* (iterative
development). We might try and solve the task of getting a drink of 
water. 


## Originating from ideas

Consider a three step process:
