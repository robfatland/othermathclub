    "\n",
    "What does 'x' become? It becomes 'y+x+y'. What does 'y' become? \n",

    "Rule S = { x --> y+x+y, y --> x-y-x }.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have left out the quotes to make it a little easier to read. \n",

    "Let's feed the string 'x' into Rule S.\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' --> S --> 'y+x+y'\n",
    "\n",
    "So far so good. Our new string has one 'x', two 'y' characters,\n",
    "and two '+' characters. Say, those are turtle move commands!\n",

    "Now let's take this result and feed it back into Rule S a second \n",
    "time:\n",
    "\n",
    "'x' --> S --> 'y+x+y' --> S --> 'x-y-x+y+x+y+x-y-x'\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh my: After only two Rule S actions we are up to 17 characters\n",
    "in our string. Each new version of the string is longer and has\n",
    "more turtle draw commands '+' and '-'. Let's ask the turtle to\n",
    "draw the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "*** Activity 2 ***\n",
    "\n",
