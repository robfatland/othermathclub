# The Fine Print

The introduction to this book lays out the program. Here I will talk about some of the details.



## The realness of an idea


Let's pursue trolls a little bit more. We are fairly sure that we could walk
the length of this earth and never come upon an actual living troll. But we will
definitely find paintings of them, stories about them, even statues and other
sculptures of trolls. So the idea of trolls is certainly a real thing. It is
something we can agree upon and discuss late into the night.


What about a seven-dimensional box? The paper or the screen I am typing on
is flat: Two dimensional. The room I occupy has three physical dimensions.
When it comes to four spatial dimensions, however: That is an idea that 
comes up because I know the number after three is four. But I do not have
any experience of four dimensions. And if I try and use something else 
like 'time' as a fourth dimension: I run into the same obstacle if I choose
five or six or seven or more dimensions. 


The story of the Fishing Kid could happen in real life. It takes advantage
of a little finesse, that the silly rule about what you can bring on the
bus does not concern 'longest dimension' but rather 'implicit dimension'
so that the bus driver is mollified by the structure of the moving box. 
But notice that the story takes an unexpected turn at the end into boxes
in higher dimensions. This is where a subtle point comes up: Does the 
*idea* of a 27-dimensional box mean such a box can be built? No. Does 
the *idea* of a 27-dimensional box exist? Certainly, just as ideas about
trolls exist. Is it a useful idea? Well the idea of trolls is very useful
because trolls make for excellent adversaries in stories.


Here is my contention: Like a warehouse our minds can store away ideas
that may or may not prove valuable. Some day the idea of a 27-dimensional cube may
come in handy. This is the unbounded nature of ideas.


## Disproving a negative (Russell's teapot)


Who dreamed it?...


It is no coincidence that Martin Gardner wrote The Annotated Alice.


## Magic tricks versus Shoulders of giants


There is a joke among geologists...


## Repetition (r...)

### ...and coding versus programming...

Sue discovers that $x - 1 = 0$ has a *solution* for $x$, namely $x = 1$. Later she
    "encounters $x^2 - 1 = 0$. Again $x = 1$ is a solution. But Sue knows that \n",
    "$-1 \\cdot -1 = 1$. A second solution is available, $x = -1$. \n",
    "Now a thought occurs: If $x^1 - 1 = 0$ has one solution and $x^2 - 1 = 0$ \n",
    "has two solutions... then perhaps $x^3 - 1 = 0$ has *three* solutions. \n",

    "of the triangle are *not* squares. We often determine the length \n",
    "of a side by taking a square root. \n",



    "Math has the notion that things are true when there is a convincing argument for them. Such an argument \n",
    "is a *proof*. We talk about proofs in the Other Math Club to understand the difference\n",
    "between 'I *think* this is true' and 'I *know* this is true and here is *why*'. You may have the \n",

    "> The things with which we concern ourselves in science appear in myriad forms, and with\n",

## Monty Hall: Emily's elegant solution\n",



    "You are a contestant on a game show. The host (Monty Hall) shows you three boxes, only one of which \n",
    "has a prize hidden inside. You are allowed to choose one of the boxes. Before its contents are revealed \n",
    "Monty Hall first opens a different box under which (he knows) there is no prize. Now there are two \n",
    "un-revealed boxes: The one you chose and the other un-revealed box. Monty now offers you the opportunity \n",
    "to switch your choice to the other box. What should you do? That is: What is your best strategy assuming \n",
    "you want to win the prize?\n",
    "\n",
    "Emily:\n",
    "Your probability of choosing correctly at the start is clearly 1 in 3. Think of two swimming pools of size 1/3\n",
    "and size 2/3. You are now sitting in the swimming pool of size 1/3 and the other two boxes are in the other larger\n",
    "swimming pool. We can agree that the numbers 1/3 and 2/3 represent the probabilities that the actual prize is in the\n",
    "two respective pools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now (after one of the empty boxes is revealed) you have the opportunity to jump into the larger swimming\n",
    "pool, the one with a probability of 2/3. You do so... and now here is where it gets interesting. If after you\n",
    "jumped into the bigger pool you had to choose between the two boxes in that pool you would have even chances\n",
    "of selecting the correct box, the one with the prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "But Monty Hall has conveniently eliminated the wrong choice. You can't possibly make a mistake when you jump\n",
    "into the larger pool and therefore your chances of winning the prize using Emily's strategy will double\n",

    "## Some problems in graph theory \n",
    "\n",
    "Terms: A graph is two sets: A set of vertices or dots and a set of lines that connect pairs of vertices. \n",
    "These lines are usually called *edges*. And by the way the singular of *vertices* is *vertex*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple graphs have at most one edge between two vertices. They also do not have loops, which are edges that\n",
    "connect a single vertex back to itself. Unless otherwise stated this part concerns such simple graphs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hamiltonian *path* passes through each vertex of a graph exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If one can arrange to make the last vertex the same as the first the Hamiltonian path becomes a Hamiltonian *circuit*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Hamiltonian *graph* is one that possesses a Hamiltonian *circuit*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Also in case it is not familiar: The *degree* of a vertex is simply the number of edges incident to that vertex.\n",
    "So if one vertex in a graph connects directly to five other vertices via five edges it is said to have degree $5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prove: A graph with $2n$ vertices and $n^2+1$ edges must contain a triangle.\n",
    "* Prove: Suppose you have a graph with an infinite number of vertices; then there is either an infinite set\n",
    "of vertices every two of which are joined by an edge, or there is an infinte set of vertices no two of\n",
    "which are joined by an edge.\n",
    "* Prove: A graph with $n>=4$ vertices and $2n-3$ edges must contain a circuit with a diagonal.\n",
    "* Prove: A graph with $n>=6$ vertices and $3n-5$ edges must contain two circuits which have no vertices in common.\n",
    "* Prove: Every graph with $n$ vertices and $n+4$ edges contains two circuits which have no edges in common.\n",
    "* Prove Dirac's theorem on Hamiltonian circuits: A graph with $n>=3$ vertices in which each vertex\n",
    "has degree at least $n/2$ has a Hamiltonian circuit.\n",
    "* Prove Ore's theorem: If $n>=3$ and, for every pair of vertices that are not joined by an edge, \n",
    "the sum of the degrees is at least $n$ then the graph is Hamiltonian. \n",
    "* Prove Posa's theorem: Let G be a simple graph with $n$ vertices. If for every $k$ in $1<=k<(n-1)/2$ the number of\n",
    "vertices of degree no exceeding $k$ is less than $k4, and if for $n$ odd the number of vertices with degree\n",
    "not exceeding $(n-1)/2$ does not exceed $(n-1)/2$ then G contains a Hamiltonian cycle.\n",

    "## Izzie Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "A student interested in Ms. Halfway suggested a different walking strategy. I have not looked at this \n",
    "in ages so I am tidying up. I do not know if my interpretation of the question is accurate; but I am\n",
    "deferring that to another day with my best guess following. I also commented out the code so that the\n",
    "solutions are not visible at the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The guess of the student's question: What if you go half-way\n",
    "forward, and from there half-way forward again, and then half-way back. \n",
    "Then repeat; so for every half-way back there are two half-way forwards.\n",
    "But I'm not sure what defines the forward and backward points to which we \n",
    "advance / retreat half-way....\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is of course \"where does this strategy land us?\" and it could be generalized. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Treat the rest of this section as un-polished notes on resolving this question... so room for improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Start at zero and make the initial goal be 1. Walk half way there, call that $x_2$. Call 0 $x_0$ and call 1 $x_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From $x_2$ walk halfway to $x_1$, call that $x_3$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From $x_3$ walk halfway back to $x_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern is then forward - forward - backward. Where do we end up? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Set $a_0 = 1/2$ and $b_0 = 3/4$. Notice that $a_0\\;<\\;b_0$, just for interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $a_1 = {\\frac{1}{8}} \\; \\cdot \\; (2a_0 + 6b_0)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Define $b_1= {\\frac{1}{8}} \\; \\cdot \\; (a_0 + 7b_0)$.\n",

    "$b_n = {\\frac{1}{8}} \\; \\cdot \\; (a_{n-1} + 7b_{n-1})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This works if you begin with the proper starting values but not the obvious 0 and 1. It is also calculated\n",
    "to ensure that $b > a$ on each iteration. The recursion builds up powers of $1/8$ but the numerators other\n",
    "factor keeps pace and the result stabilizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step was to follow the logic from zero and one as the starting values. This resulted in\n",
    "an alternating inequality: First $b > a$ then $a > b$ then $b > a$ etcetera on each iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That's fine but it also is confusing to set up the rule properly to agree with the original \n",
    "iteration function. So I tried just drawing the picture in terms of hops... and I realized\n",
    "what is given in the calculation directly above: Each iteration resets the boundary goals\n",
    "to be closer and closer together. So this could be parameterized as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$a' = a + \\alpha(b-a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$b' = a + \\beta(b-a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This operates on (0, 1) and produces the $r = 5/7$ end result, no worries. It suggests a general \n",
    "problem 'What is $r(\\alpha, \\beta)$' starting from (0, 1)?'\n",
