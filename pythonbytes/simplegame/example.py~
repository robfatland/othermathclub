# Example of a program that plays tic tac toe
#   This program takes care of most of the mechanics of the game...
#   But it does not play very cleverly.

import pygame         # gives us a nice game board to draw on
import time           # gives us the ability to put in little pauses
import random         # used to choose computer's moves
