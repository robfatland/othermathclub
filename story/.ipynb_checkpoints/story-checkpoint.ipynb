    "### A Kid Pipkin story for young readers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The time had come for Kid Pipkin's birthday party; and seeing as \n",
    "how she was turning 18 it was a momentous event; a Long Expected \n",
    "Party of great import; for one does not turn 18 every day you should \n",
    "know. Everyone had taken special care to travel to the port town\n",
    "(which we have modeled on Sitka; but it is fictional)\n",
    "and everyone had taken extra special care to arrive at the party\n",
    "on time. People who like to arrive fashionably late miss the \n",
    "best part of the party, which is the shared excitement and happiness\n",
    "to be ***at a party!!!*** I suspect that them what is fashionably \n",
    "late suffer a combination of self-conscious anxiety and a preoccupation \n",
    "with looking just so. Anyway they will get here eventually and we will\n",
    "welcome them with open arms. \n",
    "\n",
    "But back to our story... some party guests were faces familiar, as \n",
    "in small towns we see one another almost every day; but\n",
    "other guests Kid Pipkin knew were scattered far and wide and she \n",
    "had not heard from or seen them in some while. \n",
    "Of course the celebration was to be held at Fyz Byzkyn's farmhouse; \n",
    "and Kid Pipkin (being a considerate soul) had arrived well in \n",
    "advance of the start time (2PM) to help with preparations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'Oh I'm so glad you came early' exclaimed Fyz Byzkyn as she walked \n",
    "in the door. 'The horses have not been watered yet and today they \n",
    "happen to need precisely seven gallons. Would you mind terribly?' \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Kid Pipkin nodded, thankful for an important task to do, and stepped \n",
    "outside and across to the water trough where she found only unmarked\n",
    "nine and five gallon containers. She turned on the spigot but then what?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Coming back into the house she remarked 'Your horses seemed in very good spirits, Kitty Dawn particularly.' (Kitty Dawn has had only minor roles\n",
    "in the stories but she is the only named horse. When you ride Kittie Dawn\n",
    "at a gallop she finds it amusing to veer under lower tree limbs to try and\n",
    "knock you off; so you are obliged to hold onto the pommel as you\n",
    "lean over and down to one side. Someone should have a talk with her \n",
    "about this as it is really quite dangerous.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'Yes I'm not surprised they are feeling good, the horses' said Fyz Byzkyn.\n",
    "'I got in a load of fresh hay from the fields yesterday... and I think \n",
    "Kittie has been teaching the other horses and the cow to nibble blackberries \n",
    "along the fence now those have come in. July has just flown by!'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There was a knock at the door, and Kid Pipkin went to welcome... \n",
    "who would it be? In fact it proved to be Alebasi, recently escaped and \n",
    "on the lam from the law once again. She was sporting a lovely diamond \n",
    "necklace that contrasted fabulously with her t-shirt and torn jeans.  \n",
    "Further up the drive walked Abcdef Ghijklmno Pqrstuvwxyz together with\n",
    "Zyxwvutsr Qponmlkji Hgfedcba, hand in hand. They had stepped away from \n",
    "their easels at the beach and flown up to celebrate the occasion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon they were followed by Curious George walking up with the Man with \n",
    "the Yellow Hat. The Man With The Yellow hat does not speak in this story, \n",
    "for as was his custom he was present primarily to protect Curious George \n",
    "from harm, and Curious George will not be at any risk except\n",
    "perhaps of a sugar overdose. But the Man with the Yellow Hat does smile \n",
    "a great deal and he enjoys being a part of everything."

    "Dyson. Horst Borskin seemed very unhappy about something as he gesticulated\n",

    "having a good day. Her eyes swept across the \n",
    "gathering throng -- by now it was a smallish throng -- and Kid Pipkin \n",

    "Years had passed by but this seemed not to matter in the slightest: \n",

    "\n",
    "The doorbell rang again and this time it was the girl with the skirt of \n",

    "large box. She was still Mayor at this time and I am afraid we do not find \n",
    "out what was in the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon they sat down to supper (for it was as I said early afternoon), \n",
    "and this proved to be a capital meal prepared by Fyz Byzkyn in a flurry \n",
    "of smoke and odors mysterious, slightly burnt-smelling smells that\n",
    "wafted out from the kitchen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of events of this supper was peculiar by ordinary standards, \n",
    "to put it mildly: First Fyz Byzkyn brought out a birthday cake with 18 \n",
    "candles burning away, and George Dyson waved his hand and suddenly the\n",
    "little flames connected together with sparkling beams of light, to \n",
    "produce a planar graph. Then according to custom they sang Happy Birthday \n",
    "(Zyxwvutsr sang it backwards) before Kid Pipkin made a wish\n",
    "and blew the candles out. The little light beam edges of the graph,\n",
    "their candle flame vertices blown out, tumbled upward \n",
    "to strike the ceiling and puff out in smoke and sparks. 'Thank you, \n",
    "George Dyson' said Fyz Byzkyn. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The cake proved to be an Inverse Cake with three very thick layers of \n",
    "frosting separated by thin slivers of cake, and with more cake \n",
    "formed in a cylinder around about the outside and a disc of cake \n",
    "capping the top. Fyz Byzkyn seemed so pleased with \n",
    "his invention that nobody offered the observation that a cake made \n",
    "mostly of frosting was a bit on the rich side. \n",
    "And Curious George didn't mind anyway. \n",
    "After the cake was finished it was time for the main course \n",
    "of crab-stuffed mushrooms and salmon-stuffed brussels sprouts; \n",
    "and then a salad was served; and at last a series of appetizers \n",
    "appeared which all seemed to involve pesto.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is very much like the Backwards Suppers they would feed us\n",
    "in the dreadful Army\" griped Horst Borskyn with a sour expression \n",
    "and a disapproving shake of his head. \n",
    "As usual nobody had any idea what Horst Borskyn was talking about, \n",
    "particularly as he had never served in any Army... so they merely nodded \n",
    "and looked thoughtful. But then unexpectedly, once a minute or so \n",
    "of silence had passed following this peculiar remark, \n",
    "a gleam of triumph appeared in Fyz Byzkyn's eyes. Here it comes at last.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Oh ho\" he began, his eyes crinkling up as he enjoyed the moment \n",
    "beyond measure, \"this meal is not *like* a Backwards Supper, Horst Borskyn,\n",
    "it ***is*** a Backwards Supper\", and he burst into triumphant laughter. \n",
    "Once he had wiped some tears of mirth away he \n",
    "continued \"...and now I should like to know, from the birthday girl: \n",
    "How did you enjoy the Backwards Supper Kid Pipkin??\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overcome, Kid Pipkin tried to think of a suitably grandiose response...\n",
    "but what she managed to say was \"Why yes of course it was ever so much the \n",
    "most splendid birthday supper I have ever had, and the best you\n",
    "have ever cooked!'\" with a great smile beaming. (A little awkward\n",
    "perhaps but she meant every word.) Then suddenly her countenance \n",
    "faded and fell to something like sadness.  Everyone grew quiet and \n",
    "she continued in a small voice '...I only wish we \n",
    "could begin with this backwards supper and keep going backwards in time\n",
    "ever so quickly to the days when I first met you all, so many many\n",
    "years ago, \n",
    "that we might go out upon our adventures all over once again...'\n",
    "And her eyes began shedding great tears. \n",
    "Nobody spoke but they all stood up and gathered about her and \n",
    "arms reached out to create a group hug that was \n",
    "the biggest group hug any of them could remember, \n",

    "wiping of cheeks and noses."

    "\n",
    "'Oh indeed' said George Dyson 'and that was when we discovered that you \n",

    "\n",
    "'Well, one doesn't like to make a fuss' replied the girl with the orange\n",

    "unusual habitats? I mean, consider for example that George lives in \n",

    "this party) I found myself wishing it a little more difficult\n",
    "these days. With all my past practice a jail break has become \n",
    "about as difficult as shopping for groceries. Plus now come to \n",
    "think of it: I'm out of prison again! I will need\n",
    "some lodging and I must start paying rent again... so... \n",

    "what have you been up to lately?' \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "'So I have done a little mathematics and I found a way to navigate to \n",
    "what I believe we call Tomorrow;\n",
    "and since this is seemingly impossible I had to solve an \n",
    "impossible navigation problem for it to all work out. \n",
    "Specifically I will have to sail to the moon. And the way to do that \n",
    "is: You know how a full moon sets on the ocean and sometimes \n",
    "there is a kind of a \n",
    "mirage where the bottom of the moon's circumference flips over and the effect is a kind of \n",
    "an Omega shape?' (Those who knew what a capital omega looks like \n",
    "now pictured this.) \n",
    "'Well one day I was thinking about this but not in terms of\n",
    "planets moving about and orbital mechanics and atmospheric lensing\n",
    "of moonlight... \n",
    "but instead I found myself thinking in an abstract way about \n",
    "calculus on manifolds, \n",
    "and I proved to myself (I *think*) that for a couple of moments \n",
    "in the course of the full moon setting on the ocean \n",
    "I could navigate across the mirage in my sailboat...\n",
    "but only if I made a branch cut across time... \n",
    "and this would bring me to the moon but, because of the branch cut:\n",
    "not the moon *Today*. And then I sorted out that if I go about the branch \n",
    "cut *counterclockwise* I get to Yesterday.\n",
    "But this is less interesting as well as also impossible,\n",
    "as we have aready been there... we know Yesterday... \n",
    "and so that leaves me with going *clockwise* which takes me to...\n",
    "Tomorrow.\n",
    "That is where I shall go.' \n",
    "(Kid Pipkin's eyes lit up just a bit in describing all of this.)\n",
